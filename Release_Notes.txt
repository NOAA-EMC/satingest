( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)

 JOB script changes:
  JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Deleted the Processing family, "EFCLAM"  for GOES-16/17 Imager Sky Cover text files, 
      and introduced "EFCLAMZIP", for zipped GOES-16/17 Imager Sky Cover text files.
      BENEFIT: Ingesting zipped GOES-16/17 Imager Sky Cover files makes it possible to pull
               smaller-sized files, reducing data transmission time and RTMA data
               assimilation losses.
  JISNOW:
    - Removed logic that inlcuded SENDDBN_GB2 and corrected logic with SENDDBN.
      Made SENDDBN definition overrideable.
      BENEFIT: SENDDBN_GB2 is no longer needed and is removed to avoid problems.
               SENDDBN is set in upstream ecflow script.


 USH script changes:
   ingest_sncvgrib96.sh, ingest_sncvgrib.sh, ingest_snodepgr.sh:
    - $SENDDBN tests changed to be enclosed in quotes. References to SENDDBN_GB2 were
      removed due to discontinuation of deliberate separation of grib and grib2.
      BENEFIT: avoids syntax error if $SENDDBN is not defined.

 JOB script changes:
   JINPP_CRIS_399:
    - Corrected typo in PROCESSING_FAMILIES defintion which erroneously disabled
      the ingest of CRIS_APR_399 upon implementation of obsproc_satingest.v3.9.0
      on December 5, 2019.
      BENEFIT: Operational NAM is now able to process CrIS NSR data again.  NAM
               is the only operational network that was impacted by this multi-day
               data outage.


 USH script changes:
   No changes.


 Source code changes:
   bufr_tranjb (tranjb.f)
    - Applied logic originally established in obsproc_satingest.v3.2.0 to
      examine subsets written into BUFR sonde tank b002/xx101 and remap
      select reports into b002/xx001.
      BENEFIT: This temporary code change provides a solution toward
               effectively mitigating an anticipated loss of TAC radiosonde
               reports from CMA, in lieu of more comprehensive data
               processing to be provided within future code updates to be
               applied elsewhere.


 Fixed file changes:
   No changes.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Tank b002/xx001 will be populated with b002/xx101 reports selected for
   remapping.

    polulating tank b002/xx101.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   $DCOMROOT/prod/<yyyymmdd>/b002/xx001 will increase in size by
   approximately 1.5%.  A reciprocal increase in dump counts may
   be reflected in the RTDM "Hourly/RAP/Model(NAM/GFS/GDAS) Data
   Dump Tables" under the data type "raobf".

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Added "MODIS_FIRE" to Group 1 families "PROC_FAM_group1" for MODIS 
      fire data (ascii format).
      BENEFIT: MODIS fire data will be available for RAPv5/HRRRv4 models.
    - Updated filename pattern for AF_VIIRS processing family in response to
      NESDIS PDA change.

      BENEFIT: Updated VIIRS Active Fire data will be available for RAPv5/HRRRv4 models.
   JIAIRS:
    - Removed "IASI_DB" from processing families "PROCESSING_FAMILIES".
      BENEFIT: These data are availalbe on GTS and will be processed by
               decod_dcears.  The original data source, UWisc, can 
               disable their ftp feed.  The data will continue to populate
               $DCOMROOT/${envir}/<yyyymmdd>/b021/xx239.            
      NOTE: This implementation must be coordinated with the implementation of
            decod_dcears.v3.9.2.
   JIAVHRR:
    - Added ability to proceses METOP-3(C) AVHRR data.  Renamed processing family
      from "AVHRR_M1_M2" to "AVHRR_M1_M2_M3".
      BENEFIT: AVHRR data from METOP-3(C) is available for GFSv16.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Added ability to process Langley Cloud data that is ingested in
      NetCDF4 format.  The original processing family LGYCLD is renamed
      to LGYCLD_NC3 and disabled from PROCESSING_FAMILIES.  The NetCDF3
      processing is left in place in the event, shortly after implementation,
      there is need to revert to NetCDF3 format.  The LGYCLD processing
      family is modified to ingest NetCDF4 Langley Cloud data.
      BENEFIT: Langley Cloud data can be processed without interruption.
               GOES-17 and up will not provide these data in NetCDF3 format.
      NOTE: This implementation must be coordinated with the implementation of
            decod_dcncld.v4.0.1.
    - Added ability to process GOES-16 Clear Sky Radiance baseline data and
      GOES-16 All Sky Radiance baseline data. 
      BENEFIT: Clear and All Sky Radiance data are available for RAPv5 and 
               GFSv16.
      NOTE: At the time of release these data were not yet available on PDA. 
            Until they are available these data will be ingested from NESDIS
            STAR's FTP server.
   JINPP_ATMS:
    - Removed "ATMS_DB" from processing families "PROCESSING_FAMILIES".
      BENEFIT: These data are availalbe on GTS and will be processed by
               decod_dcears.  The original data source, UWisc, can
               disable their ftp feed.  The data will continue to populate
               $DCOMROOT/${envir}/<yyyymmdd>/b021/xx213.
      NOTE: This implementation must be coordinated with the implementation of
            decod_dcears.v3.9.2.
   JINPP_CRIS_399:
    - Removed "CRIS_APR_399_DB" from processing families "PROCESSING_FAMILIES".
      BENEFIT: These data are availalbe on GTS and will be processed by
               decod_dcears.  The original data source, UWisc, can
               disable their ftp feed.  The data will continue to populate
               $DCOMROOT/${envir}/<yyyymmdd>/b021/xx212.
      NOTE: This implementation must be coordinated with the implementation of
            decod_dcears.v3.9.2.
   JINPP_OMPS:
    - Added "OMPS_LP" to processing families "PROCESSING FAMILIES".
      BENEFIT: NPP OMPS Limb Profiler data will be available for GFSv16.
      NOTE: At time of release, the data files are retrieved from:
            ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov.
            These data are not yet on NESDIS PDA.  Once the data are
            available on PDA, coordination will be made between EMC and
            NCO to create the data subscription.
   JIPOES_SST:
    - Added NOAA-20 VIIRS SST data to processing families "VIIRS_CLEAR_SKY,"
      "VIIRS_PROBCLEAR_SKY," and "VIIRS_ALL_LEFT."
      BENEFIT: VIIRS SST data from NOAA-20 is available for GFSv16.
      NOTE: While NOAA-20 was added for "VIIRS_ALL_LEFT", this processing
            family is not activated.
   JISWD:
    - Modified GOES DMW processing families "IRCD_DMW", "WVICS_DMW",
      "VISB_DMW", "WVICT_DMW", "SHRTWV_DMW" to ingest wind data that has the 
      BUFR format sequence change as mandated by WMO: BUFR v31 sequence 3-10-077.
    - Replaced processing familiy "VIIRS" with "NB_VIIRS".  The renamed
      processing family ingests wind data that has the new BUFR format
      sequence change as mandated by WMO BUFR v31 sequence 3-10-077.
    - The NB_VIIRS data will populate a new tank, b005/xx091.

   This is part of OBSPROC.v12.0.0.
   This release is in support of the data upgrade for RAPv5/HRRRv4 as well
   as a portion of the data upgrade for GFSv16.
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:
      v4.0.1 of decod_dcncld,
      v3.9.2 of decod_dcears.
   This must be implemented prior to December 31, 2019, when NESDIS will
   cease dissemination of legacy BUFR sequence GOES and polar orbiter
   DMW/AMV data.  After December 31, 2019 only the WMO BUFR v31 sequence 
   will be provided.
   This must be implemented on Dell phase 3.  Changes should also be applied to phase 1.
   NOTE the following guidance for PDA subscriptions:
    - METOP AVHRR subscription may need to be modified to ingest from METOP-3 satellite
    - VIIRS SST subscriptions may need to be modified to ingest from NOAA-20 satellite
    - In order to ingest the WMO BUFR v31 AMV data from NPP and NOAA-20 a new PDA
      subscription will need to be enabled. 
    - In order to ingest the WMO BUFR v31 DMW data from GOES-16/-17 a new PDA
      subscription will need to be enabled.
   NOTE the following guidance for ftp servers:
    - ensure ability to connect to wcoss_nasa@ftps-out1.ncep.noaa.gov to ingest 
      Langley cloud data
    - ensure ability to connect to wcoss_nasa@ftps-out1.ncep.noaa.gov to ingest 
      MODIS fire data
    - ensure ability to connect to ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov to ingest GOES-16
      Clear-sky and All-sky radiance data.
    - ensure ability to connect to ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov to ingest OMPS Limb Profiler
      data.

 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Updated all JI* scripts to replace "us007003" with "${envir}" to comply
      with Dell phase3 dcom directory structure.
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Added "AF_VIIRS" to Group 1 families "PROC_FAM_group1" for NPP 
      & NOAA-20 Active Fire data (ascii format).
      BENEFIT: The Active Fire data from VIIRS on board NOAA-20 and NPP
               will be available for RAP and air quality models.
    - Updated processing family group #7 to only attempt data ingest between
      hours 05 and 10.  NESDIS has updated the availability of v003 GBBEPx
      global emissions files to be ~08Z.  This is a change from the v002 files
      being available ~16Z and the pull window was between hours 13 and 18.
      BENEFIT: A more timely ingest of data files will benefit downstream 
               model applications that process these products.
   JISWD - GOES-17 DMW, Leo-Geo wind data
    - Added "LEO-GEO" processing familiy to process LEO-GEO satellite
      wind data provided by Univ. of Wisc.
      BENEFIT: Satellite wind data processed from leo-geo will now be
               ingested into BUFR /dcom database file NC005072.  Ultimately 
               these data will be processed into the "satwnd" dump file 
               when GFS and GDAS GSI are ready.
    - Updated processing families: "IRCD_DMW", "WVICS_DMW", "VISB_DMW",
      "WVICT_DMW", and "SHRTWV_DMW" to process GOES-17 AMVs.  Files are
      pulled from PDA with generalized names w.r.t. pattern matching.
      BENEFIT: AMV's generated from GOES-17 infrared/long-wave (processing
               family "IRCD_DMW"), water vapor imager/deep-layer ("WVICS_DMW"),
               visible ("VISB_DMW"), water vapor imager/cloud-top ("WVICT_DMW"),
               and infrared/short-wave ("SHRTWV_DMW") channels will now be
               ingested into BUFR /dcom database files NC005030, NC005031,
               NC005032, NC005034, and NC005039, resp, and then into the
               downstream "satwnd" dump files for assimilation in the GFS and
               GDAS GSI (only, for now).  GOES-17 is expected to replace GOES-15
               as the operational GOES-W satellite in July 2019.
   JITOV - Metop-C AMSUA and MHS data
    - Added Metop-C satellite data files to the AMSUA and MHS processing
      families.
      BENEFIT: The AMSUA data generated from METOP-C will now be ingested into
               BUFR /dcom database file NC021023 for brightness temperatures and
               file NC021123 for antenna temperatures.  The MHS data generated
               from METOP-C will now be ingested into BUFR /dcom database file
               NC021027 for brightness temperatures.
     - Place holders are in place for HIRs-4 data when these data become 
       available from METOP-C.
   JINPP_CRIS_399 - NUCAPS CrIS 399, both standard and direct broadcast
    - New filenames because of NESDIS NDE upgrade for version change.
      Old:
      PDAFileLinks/NDE/NUCAPS/NUCAPS-C0399_v1r0_npp_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr
      /santek/DB_BUFR/ALL/NUCAPS-C0399_v1r0_npp_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.DB.bufr

      BENEFIT: No interruption in ingesting CrIS 399 data from PDA and UWisc.
   JISNOW - 8th mesh USAF Northern & Southern Hemisphere snow depth products
    - Removed ingest and copy of the USAF 8th mesh Northern & Southern Hemisphere snow depth products.
      USAF wants to discontinue these products.  All downstream users of these products have transitioned
      to processing the 16th mesh equivalent products.
   JIPOES_SST -
    - New filename because of NESDIS NDE upgrade for version change.

 JOB script changes:
   For all J-Jobs:
    - Removed phase 1 utility variables and paths, replacing
      them with phase 3 utility variables and paths.
    - modified $USERDIR, $TANKDIR, and $OUTDIR variables to adopt the
      phase3 setting for prod_envir variable $DCOMROOT.  The legacy 
      (pre-phase3) location of /gpfs/[t][g]p1/nco/ops/dcom/us007003/YYYYMMDD 
      will change to the following location on phase 3:
      /gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/dcom/$envir/YYYYMMDD, where $envir can be prod,
      para, or dev.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh
    - Removed lines for module load phase 1 libraries and added lines for
      module load phase 3 libraries.
    - Commented out "set -e" since it fails for module load hdf5 version 1.8.20.
   load_libs.rc
    - Changed the libs and module loads from phase 1 to phase 3.
   setlibs.rc
    - Deleted since full directories of libs are intentionally hidden on phase 3
      machine to discourage the use of full paths, load_libs.rc is used instead.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_tranjb.sh, ingest_check_lapsed_data.sh, ingest_process_days.sh, 
   ush/ingest_sncvgrib.sh, ush/ingest_sncvgrib96.sh, ush/ingest_snodepgr.sh,
   ingest_translate_orbits.sh:
    - Modified phase 1 utility vairables and script lines to run on 
      phase 3 machine.

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
   - Added "NIC_LKS" to Group 1 families "PROC_FAM_group1" for Great Lakes ice
     concentration data from National Ice Center (zipped ascii format).
   - Modified JIAEROSOL to add AVHRR Weekly GVF retirement. The product is 
     scheduled to retire on April 12, 2018.
   JIAVHRR:
   - Added "AVHRR_18_19" and "AVHRR_M1_M2" to the processing families to 
     combine two AVHRR-GAC satellites into a single tank, i.e., retaining 
     NOAA-18 and adding NOAA-19 (both p.m.) in tank b021/xx053 (clear & sea), 
     xx054 (cloud or land); retaining METOP-A and adding METOP-B (both a.m.) 
     in tank b021/xx051 (clear & sea), xx052 (cloud or land).
   JIGOES_RADSND:
   - Added "LGYCLD" to the processing families to change processing NASA
     Langley cloud data from NASA servers to NCO's ftp server. Removed "LGYCLD1"
     and "LGYCLD2" used for NASA servers from the processing families. Commented
     out lines for processing data from NASA servers.
   - Removed GOES-13 data file links from processing families "IMGR", "LGYCLD",
     and "EFCLAM" since they are no longer available.
   JINPP_ATMS:
   - Uncommented lines to turn on ingest process for NOAA-20 ATMS data.
   JINPP_CrIS_431:
   - Uncommented lines to turn on ingest process for NOAA-20 CrIS FSR 431 data.
   JIPOES_SST:
   - Added "VIIRS_CLEAR_SKY", "VIIRS_PROBCLEAR_SKY", and "VIIRS_ALL_LEFT" to
     the processing families to process VIIRS SST data in 3 varieties.
     Turned off VIIRS_ALL_LEFT since the tank size is huge and nobody uses it
   - Added "AMSR2_SST" to the processing families to process GCOM-W/AMSR2 
     Sea Surface Temperatures
   - Turned off navo sst lookalike bundles since it is no longer needed.
   - Removed NOAA-18 from NAVY AVHRR SST since NAVOCEANO will cease the production 
     and distribution of MCSST products derived from NOAA-18 GAC data on May 14, 2018.
   - Removed VIIRS_ACSPO since it was turned off before and bufr tank b012/xx023
     is now used by newly introduced "VIIRS_CLEAR_SKY" category of VIIRS SST.
   JISWD:
   - Removed GOES-E (goes-13) data file links from processing families "IRCD",
     "WVIMG", "VISB", and "SHRTWV" since they are no longer available.

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab.012:
    - Added new Table A entries (message types):
        NC012023 - holds NPP/VIIRS SST (clear sky w/o land)
        NC012024 - holds NPP/VIIRS SST (probably clear sky w/o land)
        NC012025 - holds NPP/VIIRS SST (left w/ land)
        NC012222 - holds GCOM-W/AMSR2 Sea Surface Temperatures
      These include new Table D mnemonics SST0, SSTB, SSTD, ACSQ, IANG, AANG,
        SANG, and minor description change for SRDA.
   bufrtab.021:
    - Changed the descriptor for GCRCHN from 3-50-217 to 3-50-220:
      It was discovered that two different Table B entries (IASIQF - IASI 
      CHANNEL QUALITY FLAGS and GCRCHN - NPP CrIS GUARD CHANNEL DATA) are 
      using the same descriptor 3-50-217. 

 Output changes:

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JIAVHRR, JIGOES_RADSND, JIGOES_SST, JIOZONE14,
   JIOZONE_ORBIT, JIPOES_SST, JIQST, JISMI, JISNOW, JISWD, JITOV:
   - Modified machine from DDS to PDA (ops) and, in these cases,
     TRANSFER_COMMAND changed from wget to lftp and file directory paths changed
     from "pull/" on DDS to new sub-directories under "PDAFileLinks/PULL/" on
     PDA server.
     BENEFIT:  Requirement now that NESDIS is migrating from DDS to PDA machine.
   JINPP_OMPS:
    - For processing families "OMPSTC_V8" and "OMPSNP_V8", the script is set-up
      to now process multiple files (PROC_MULT_FILES set to YES) up to a maximum
      of 150 files (IFILES_MAX_MULT set to 150) (if > 150 files, will process
      single files as before).
      BENEFIT: PROC_MULT_FILES=YES speeds up processing over single file
               processing scenario, especially as the day goes on and the
               database file it writes to grows in size.
   JIOZONE14:
    - In processing family "OZONE19_V8bufr", remove the setting of envirmonment
      variable $REMOTEDIRGRP to default value "." This is now done in model
      script existday.sh.ecf where it can be more generally applied (see below).
      In any event, this variable is no longer applicable to family
      "OZONE19_V8bufr" since files here are now pulled from PDA via lftp.

 Model script changes:
   existday.sh.ecf:
    -  Modified to hardwire environment variable $REMOTEDIRGRP to ".", its
       default value in child script ingest_get.sh. This variable is only
       invoked when ingest_get.sh is executed downstream from model script
       existore.sh.ecf. It is set here to avoid an "unset variable" error in
       ingest_get.sh when that script is executed downstream from this model
       script (existday.sh.ecf) and $TRANSFER_COMMAND is imported as "ftp" or
       "wget".

   This is (the only) part of OBSPROC.v8.2.0.

   ====================================

   =====>  I M P O R T A N T

    --->  Since obsproc_satingest.v3.4.2 was previously implemented do this:

   When running a para-prod test on devwcoss beginning with 12z cycle:
   At any time prior to 12z when you want to implement obsproc_satingest.v3.6.0:
      1) Shut down entire satingest on devwcoss.
      2) Implement obsproc_satingest.v3.6.0 on devwcoss.
      3) On devwcoss, execute: /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/SVN/IMPLEMENTATION_RELEASES/obsproc_satingest_RB-3.6.0/pre_paraprod_impl_script.bash .
      4) Turn on entire satingest on devwcoss.
   After para-prod test on devwcoss has completed:
      1) Shut down entire satingest on devwcoss.
      2) Fall back to production obsproc_satingest on devwcoss.
      3) On devwcoss, execute: /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/SVN/IMPLEMENTATION_RELEASES/obsproc_satingest_RB-3.6.0/post_paraprod_script.bash .
      4) Turn on entire satingest on devwcoss.

   When actually implementing obsproc_satingest.v3.6.0 into production:
      1) Shut down entire satingest on prodwcoss and devwcoss.
      2) Implement obsproc_satingest.v3.6.0 on prodwcoss and devwcoss.
      3) On prodwcoss and devwcoss, execute: /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/SVN/IMPLEMENTATION_RELEASES/obsproc_satingest_RB-3.6.0/pre_paraprod_impl_script.bash .
      4) Turn on entire satingest on prodwcoss and devwcoss.

   ====================================

   - IMPORTANT: The ingest web page has not yet been updated to reflect the
                changes here.

   Please export file
   https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/obsproc/branches/VS/versions/OBSPROC-v8.2.0/obsproc_satingest.ver
   and copy to /nwprod/versions, replacing like-named file.

   There is no change to /nwprod/versions/dbnet_tranjb.ver (continues to export
    obsproc_satingest_ver=v3.2.1 and obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver=v1.0.0).
   There is no change to /nwprod/versions/poes_phyret_sst.ver (continues to

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Generalized the setting of $MACHINE, in cases where the default is the ops
      PDA server (140.90.190.143), so as to allow both the default and its
      potential overrider, $PDA_SERVER, to be overriden if $MACHINE is set in a
      driver script.
      BENEFIT: Gives more flexibility (likely in para or test runs) where
               $MACHINE can be set to something other then $PDA_SERVER in the
               ecflow scripts.
   JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JIPOES_SST, JISWD:
    - Minor comment changes.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Added GOES-16 to the list of files pulled (w/ GOES-13 and -15) in the LaRC
      cloud processing families "LGYCLD2" (primary) and "LGYCLD1" (backup).
      BENEFIT: At time of this script's implementation, GOES-16 will not yet be
               populated in the specified directory path locations by LaRC
               ("LGYCLD2") and GSD ("LGYCLD1") (it will instead be populated in
               test directories by the providers), however once the GOES-16
               cloud data are validated it will be moved into the specified
               directory path locations by LaRC and GSD and replace GOES-13
               which will be removed.  This change provides a seamless
               transition from GOES-13 to GOES-16 as the GOES-E source of LaRC
               cloud data in NCEP production (assimilated by NAM and RAP)
               (GOES-16 becomes GOES-E in mid-December 2017).
    - The backup source for LaRC cloud data (in processing family "LGYCLD1") is
      being moved from the LaRC server integrity.larc.nasa.gov to the ESRL
      server gsdftp.fsl.noaa.gov (while pulls data from LaRC).
      NOTE: NWPROD MUST ADD the line
              machine gsdftp.fsl.noaa.gov login anonymous password ????@noaa.gov
            IN ITS .netrc file. [The password is nwprod's email address, please
            provide this to Bob Lipschutz at ESRL (Robert.C.Lipschutz@noaa.gov)
            so it can be added to their allowed user list.]
      BENEFIT: integrity.larc.nasa.gov has not been functional for quite some
               time, thus there has not been a backup to the primary server
               typhoon.larc.nasa.gov (in processing family "LGYCLD2").  This
               change restores the backup in the event typhoon goes down.
       - Since the ESRL server populates these files in a different directory
         path than the LaRC server, a new environment variable $REMOTEDIRGRP
         in both "LGYCLD2" and "LGYCLD1" exports the directory path to
         downstream ush scripts (see below), while the existing environment
         variable REMOTEDSNGRP is modified in both processsing families to
         contain only filename patterns, rather than the complete path to the
         filename patterns.
         BENEFIT:  This allows "LGYCLD2" and "LGYCLD1" to store file listings
                   in same history files (meaning no double processing of files
                   present on both servers).
          - Since typhoon.larc.nasa.gov has a backup in gsdftp.fsl.noaa.gov,
            and since legacy and new GOES-E satellites are currently both listed
            here (to allow seamless transition), the number of query attempts is
            reduced from 2 to 1 and the wget connection timeout limit is set to
            30 seconds in "LGYCLD2" (matches values in "LGYCLD1").
            BENEFIT: Speeds up processing in event of connection or query
                     problems (for query no more waiting 30 sec and trying
                     again; for connection removes danger of a hung connection
                     halting all processing).
    - Added GOES-16 to the list of files pulled (w/ GOES-13 and -15) in the
      UW/SSEC imager effective cloud amount (sky-cover) processing family
      "EFCLAM".
      BENEFIT: At time of this script's implementation, GOES-16 will not yet be
               populated in the specified directory path location by UW/SSEC
               (it will instead be populated in a test directory by UW/SSEC),
               however once the GOES-16 sky-cover data are validated it will be
               moved into the specified directory path locations by UW/SSEC and
               replace GOES-13 which will be removed.  This change provides a
               seamless transition from GOES-13 to GOES-16 as the GOES-E source
               of sky-cover data in NCEP production (assimilated by RTMA and
               URMA) (GOES-16 becomes GOES-E in mid-December 2017).
       - Since legacy and new GOES-E satellites are currently both listed here
         (to allow seamless transition), the number of query attempts is reduced
         from 2 to 1.
         BENEFIT: Speeds up processing by 30 sec since 1 of the 2 GOES-E
                  satellites will not be found.
   JINPP:
    - Removed.
      Split into five new job scripts, JINPP_ATMS, JINPP_CRIS_2211,
      JINPP_CRIS_399, JINPP_CRIS_431 and JINPP_CRIS_OMPS (see below).  
      BENEFIT: These five jobs will be submitted simultaneously.  This should
               greatly optimize the ingest of S-NPP and future JPSS-1 data from
               PDA.
   JINPP_ATMS:
    - New. Processes the "ATMS" and "ATMS_DB" families. These families were
      moved out of the now-removed job script JINPP (see above).  In the "ATMS"
      family files are still pulled from the ops PDA string, and only from the
      S-NPP satellite.  However, commented-out logic has been added which would
      also look for files from the new JPSS-1 (NOAA-20) satellite (these will be
      available on ops PDA in the near future).  The script is set-up to now
      process multiple files (PROC_MULT_FILES set to YES) up to a maximum of 150
      files (IFILES_MAX_MULT set to 150) (if > 150 files, will process single
      files as before). (Note: In the "ATMS_DB" family, files also remain
      available only from S-NPP.)
      BENEFIT: In the "ATMS" family, once JPSS-1 files are available on PDA and
               NCO has run some initial tests in para, the commented logic can
               be invoked allowing the JPSS-1 data to be ingested for testing,
               initially, in the GFS GSI.  PROC_MULT_FILES=YES speeds up
               processing over single file processing scenario, especially as
               the day goes on and the database file it writes to grows in size.
   JINPP_CRIS_2211:
    - ===> NOTE: This job will not be executed at this time since the files it
                 generates are to large to currently use in the GSI.
      New. Processes the new CrIS Full Spectral Radiance 2211 Channel Family
      ("CRIS_FSR_2211"). It is pulled from the ops PDA string and, by default,
      looks for files from both S-NPP (present now) and JPSS-1 (present soon).
      (There is also an option to process only S-NPP, but this is commented
      out.) It is set-up to process multiple files (PROC_MULT_FILES set to YES)
      up to a maximum of 150 files (IFILES_MAX_MULT set to 150) (if > 150 files,
      will process single files).
      BENEFIT: S-NPP files will be ingested now for testing, initially, in the
               GFS GSI. JPSS-1 files (when available on PDA) will be ingested
               for testing, initially, in the GFS GSI (however, the option to
               process only S-NPP is available to NCO if they would like to
               first run tests when JPSS-1 files begin appearing on PDA).
               PROC_MULT_FILES=YES speeds up processing over single file
               processing scenario, especially as the day goes on and the
               database file it writes to grows in size.
   JINPP_CRIS_399:
    - New. Processes the CrIS Apodized Radiance 399 Channel global broadcast
      ("CRIS_APR_399") and UW/SSEC direct broadcast "CRIS_APR_399_DB" families
      (still from just S-NPP satellite). These families (previously called
      "CRIS" and "CRIS_DB", resp.) were moved out of now-removed job script
      JINPP (see above). The "CRIS_APR_399" family is now set-up to now process
      multiple files (PROC_MULT_FILES set to YES) up to a maximum of 150 files
      (IFILES_MAX_MULT set to 150) (if > 150 files, will process single files as
      before).
      BENEFIT: PROC_MULT_FILES=YES speeds up processing over single file
               processing scenario, especially as the day goes on and the
               database file it writes to grows in size.
   JINPP_CRIS_431:
    - New. Processes the new CrIS Full Spectral Radiance Subset 431 Channel
      Family ("CRIS_FSR_431"). It is pulled from the ops PDA string and only
      from the S-NPP satellite.  However, commented-out logic has been added
      which would  also look for files from the new JPSS-1 (NOAA-20) satellite
      (these will be available on ops PDA in the near future).  It is set-up to
      process multiple files (PROC_MULT_FILES set to YES) up to a maximum of 150
      files (IFILES_MAX_MULT set to 150) (if > 150 files, will process single
      files).
      BENEFIT: Once JPSS-1 files are available on PDA and NCO has run some
               initial tests in para, the commented logic can be invoked
               allowing the JPSS-1 data to be ingested for testing, initially,
               in the GFS GSI.  PROC_MULT_FILES=YES speeds up processing over
               single file processing scenario, especially as the day goes on
               and the database file it writes to grows in size.
   JINPP_OMPS:
    - New. Processes the new OMPS BUFR Version 8 Total Column Ozone Family
      ("OMPSTC_V8"), tanked into database files b008/xx018, and the new OMPS
      BUFR Version 8 Nadir Profile Ozone Family ("OMPSNP_V8"), tanked into
      database files b008/xx017 (both still from just S-NPP satellite).
      BENEFIT: These are now on ESPDS/PDA and replace the OMPS BUFR Version 6
               total column ozone ("OPMSTC") and nadir profile ozone ("OMPSNP")
               data that had been tanked into database files b008/xx016 and
               b008/xx014, resp. by the now-removed JINPP job. CPC is testing
               these.
   JIOZONE14:
    - In processing family "OZONE19_V8bufr", set new envirmonment variable
      $REMOTEDIRGRP to default value "." This is needed because the value of
      $REMOTEDIRGRP is tested in downstream ush script ingest_get.sh (see
      below).
   JISWD:
    - Added five new processing families: "IRCD_DMW", "WVICS_DMW", "VISB_DMW",
      "WVICT_DMW" and "SHRTWV_DMW" to process GOES-16 AMVs (IR long-wave, WV
      imgr clear-sky, VIZ, WV imgr cloud-top and IR short wave, resp.).  All are
      set to process by default.  Files are pulled from PDA with generalized
      names w.r.t. pattern-matching (i.e., using "?M?" since there is a
      possibility that NESDIS may change the filename qualifier containing "DMW"
      to "AMV" at some point in the future).
      BENEFIT: AMV's generated from GOES-16 infrared/long-wave (processing
               family "IRCD_DMW"), water vapor imager/deep-layer ("WVICS_DMW"),
               visible ("VISB_DMW"), water vapor imager/cloud-top ("WVICT_DMW")
               and infrared/short-wave ("SHRTWV_DMW") channels will now be
               ingested into BUFR /dcom database files NC005030, NC005031,
               NC005032, NC005034 and NC005039, resp. and then into the
               downstream "satwnd" dump files for assimilation in the GFS and
               GDAS GSI (only, for now).  GOES-16 is expected to replace GOES-13
               as the operational GOES-E satellite in mid-December 2017.

 Model script changes:
   existore.sh.ecf:
    -  Modified to pass along new environment variable $REMOTEDIRGRP which, when
       set, specifies the directory path to $REMOTEDSNGRP, which is then defined
       as the files containing the leading portion of the name of a family of
       files from the remote unix machine.  This is invoked only when
       $TRANSFER_COMMAND is imported as "ftp" or "wget". $REMOTEDIRGRP must
       begin with "/".  If $REMOTEDIRGRP is not set it defaults to "." (current
       directory) and $REMOTEDSNGRP is expected to contain the complete path to
       the leading portion of the name of a family of files from the remote unix
       machine (it's "normal" definition).
       BENEFIT: Allows two different file families pulling the same file names
                from two different servers (e.g., a primary and backup) in two
                different directories to store file listings in same history
                files.  Currently used in the processing families "LGYCLD1" and
                "LGYCLD2" in job JIGOES_RADSND - needed because "LGYCLD1" (the
                new backup) currently pulls LaRC GOES cloud files from an ESRL
                gsdftp server in a different directory than the same files
                pulled by "LGYCLD2" (the primary) which continues to pull these
                same files from the LaRC typhoon server.

 USH script changes:
   ingest_check_lapsed_data.sh, ingest_process_onetype_neworbits.sh:
    - Updated definition of $REMOTEDSNGRP in Docblock.
   ingest_get.sh:
    - New imported environment variable $REMOTEDIRGRP {directory path to
      remote_file (then defined as file names only), if not set to default of
      '.' (current directory)}. Invoked only when $TRANSFER_COMMAND is "ftp" or
      "wget".  REMOTEDIRGRP must begin with "/".
      BENEFIT: Allows two different file families pulling the same file names
               from two different servers (e.g., a primary and backup) in two
               different directories to store file listings in same history
               files.
    - The lftp connection timeout limit is set to 120 seconds.
      BENEFIT: Removes the danger of a hung connection halting all processing
               until it is discovered by the NCO SPAs.  (This addresses NCO
               bugzilla ticket 604.)
   ingest_process_onetype_newdays.sh:
    - Fixed a minor comment typo.
   ingest_process_onetype_neworbits.sh:
    - Identify any new files which are likely repeats and would not be processed
      and adjust value of "num_files" to not include these.
      BENEFIT: Such files will not then be included when "num_files" is compared
               to values for IFILES_MAX_GET or IFILES_MAX_MULT to make
               processing decisions. Can help a lot in very rare situations
               where there are a lot of "repeat files showing up in the
               satingest history (due to the upstream remote server re-posting
               large numbers of files that previously aged off the server, again
               rare but has been known to happen).
   ingest_query.sh:
    - New imported environment variable $REMOTEDIRGRP [directory path to
      $REMOTEDSNGRP (then defined as file names only), if not set to default of
      '.' (current directory)}. Invoked only when $TRANSFER_COMMAND is "ftp" or
      "wget".  REMOTEDIRGRP must begin with "/".
      BENEFIT: Allows two different file families pulling the same file names
               from two different servers (e.g., a primary and backup) in two
               different directories to store file listings in same history
               files.
    - The lftp connection timeout limit is set to 120 seconds.
      BENEFIT: Removes the danger of a hung connection halting all processing
               until it is discovered by the NCO SPAs.  (This addresses NCO
               bugzilla ticket 604.)

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc and setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Upgraded w3emc version from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0.
    - Upgraded bacio version from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.
   bufr_transkycovr (transkycovr.f90):
    - Updated to handle GOES-16 through GOES-19.
      BENEFIT: Imager Sky Cover data from GOES-16 can now be processed. This
               will become available soon since GOES-16 is expected to replace
               GOES-13 as the operational GOES-E satellite in mid-December 2017.

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab.005:
    - Added new Table A entries (message types):
        NC005030 - holds GOES-16 infrared/long-wave AMV's
        NC005031 - holds GOES-16 water vapor imager/deep-layer AMV's
        NC005032 - holds GOES-16 visible AMV's
        NC005034 - holds GOES-16 water vapor imager/cloud-top AMV's
        NC005039 - holds GOES-16 infrared/short-wave AMV's
      These include new Table D mnemonics AMVAHA, AMVIII, AMVIVR, AMVIVS,
      AMVIVE, AMVCLD, AMVQIC, and new Table B mnemonics DOMO, OSQN, GSES, GPTI,
      SIID, CTRE, ATRE, WDPF, EHAM, LTDS, CLATH, BEARAZ, ORBN, CHNM, CLONH,
      VSAT, METFET, DNQL, FOST, VSNWP, MUCE, UWND, VWND, UMWV, VWMV, TCOV, COPT,
      ILWP, EMMI, CLTP, HOCT, CDTP, CLDP, CLDMNT, XEEM, YEEM, AXEE, SOFTV, DBID,
      CVWD, OECS, AMVQ, COTH.
   bufrtab.008:
    - Added new Table A entry (message type):
        NC008018 - holds BUFR Version 8 OMPS total column ozone data
      This includes new Table D mnemonic OZPROFSQ.
    - Added new WMO standard Table D mnemonic SBUV2OZN which is then used as the
      only descriptor to define existing Table A messages types NC008011 (BUFR
      Version 8 ATOVS SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data) and NC008017 (BUFR
      Version 8 OMPS nadir profile ozone data).
      BENEFIT: Streamlines the table.
    - Improved the description for some Table A, B and D entries at top of
      table.
    - Additional changes to streamline the table.
   bufrtab.021:
    - Added new Table A entries (message types):
        NC021206 - holds CrIS full spectral radiance data (431 channel subset)
      These include new Table D mnemonics CRCHNM, GCRCHN, CRISCS, VIIRCH, and
      new Table B mnemonic SCHRAD.
    - Improved the description for some Table A entries at top of table.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JIGOES_RADSND:
    - The /dcom database file b012/xx150 will contain cloud products from
      GOES-16 (BUFR satellite id 270) rather than from GOES-13 (BUFR satellite
      id 257) once GOES-16 replaces GOES-13 in the LaRC server. At that point
      they will replace GOES-13 in the downstream "lgycld" dump files in the NAM
      and RAP and will be assimilated in place of GOES-13 in these network
      GSI's. (GOES-16 will also replace GOES-13 at that point in the downstream
      "lgycld" dump files in the CDAS where they are not assimilated.)
    - The /dcom database file b012/xx160 will contain imager effective cloud
      amount (sky-cover) products from GOES-16 (BUFR satellite id 270) rather
      than from GOES-13 (BUFR satellite id 257) once GOES-16 replaces GOES-13 in
      the UW/SSEC server.  At that point they will replace GOES-13 in the
      downstream "efclam" dump files in the RTMA and URMA and will be
      assimilated in place of GOES-13 in these network GSI's.
   Job JISWD:
    - New database file b005/xx030 will contain GOES-16 IR/long-wave AMV's. New
      database file b005/xx031 will contain GOES-16 WV imager/deep-layer AMV's.
      New database file b005/xx032 will contain GOES-16 visible AMV's. New
      database file b005/xx034 will contain GOES-16 WV imager/cloud-top AMV's.
      New database file b005/xx039 will contain GOES-16 IR/short-wave AMV's.
    - Eventually (~2 Jan 2018), the database files b005/xx010, b005/xx011,
      b005/xx012 and b005/xx019; as well as downstream "satwnd" dump files in
      the CDAS, GDAS, GFS, NAM, RAP, RTMA and URMA; will no longer include
      GOES-13 AMV products. Only the GDAS and GFS will assimilate GOES-E AMV's
      (see obsproc_global.v3.1.0 Release Notes for more information).
   Job JINPP_ATMS:
    - Existing database file b021/xx203; as well as downstream "atms" dumps in
      CDAS, GDAS, GFS, NAM and RAP; will eventually contain JPSS-1 ATMS
      brightness temperature data when it is on PDA (along with existing S-NPP
      brightness temperature data) and logic in this job script is updated to
      include it. At that time these will be tested in the GDAS and GFS, and
      eventually also in the NAM and RAP.
   Job JINPP_CRIS_431:
    - New database file b021/xx206 will contain S-NPP (now) and JPSS-1 (future
      when on PDA and logic in this job script is updated to include it) CrIS
      Full Spectral Radiance Subset 431 Channel data.
   Job JINPP_OMPS:
    - New database files b008/xx017 and b008/xx018 will contain BUFR Version 8
      nadir profile and total column ozone data, resp.
    - Database files b008/xx014 (BUFR Version 6 nadir profile ozone) and
      b008/xx016 (BUFR Version 6 total column ozone) are no longer present.
   No other changes.

 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   No changes in requested resources in the job cards for any jobs.
      - New jobs JINPP_ATMS, JINPP_CRIS_2211, JINPP_CRIS_399, JINPP_CRIS_431 and
        JINPP_OMPS should have the same requested resources in their job cards
        as now-removed job JINPP.
   No changes to memory usage for any jobs.
      - New jobs JINPP_ATMS, JINPP_CRIS_2211, JINPP_CRIS_399, JINPP_CRIS_431 and
        JINPP_OMPS should have the same memory usage as now-removed job JINPP.
   Job JISWD:
    - Will finish ~2-3 sec later for every new GOES-16 file processed.
      Approximately 160 GOES-16 files are processed / day.
      Once GOES-13 goes away this time will essentially be recovered.
   Jobs JINPP_ATMS, JINPP_CRIS_2211, JINPP_CRIS_399, JINPP_CRIS_431 and
   JINPP_OMPS:
    - Since these will run simultaneuously, each should finish in, at most, the
      current run time of now-removed job JINPP.  Spliting these jobs up and
      running them simultaneouly should alieviate any processing backlogs in the
      event of a glitch on PDA.
   No changes to run time for any other jobs.

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v8.0.4

   ====================================

   =====>  I M P O R T A N T

   When running a para-prod test on devwcoss beginning with 12z cycle:
   At any time prior to 12z when you want to implement obsproc_satingest.v3.4.2:
      1) Shut down entire satingest on devwcoss.
      2) Implement obsproc_satingest.v3.4.2 on devwcoss.
      3) On devwcoss, execute: /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/SVN/IMPLEMENTATION_RELEASES/obsproc_satingest_RB-3.4.2/pre_paraprod_impl_script.bash .
      4) Turn on entire satingest on devwcoss.
   After para-prod test on devwcoss has completed:
      1) Shut down entire satingest on devwcoss.
      2) Fall back to production obsproc_satingest on devwcoss.
      3) On devwcoss, execute: /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/SVN/IMPLEMENTATION_RELEASES/obsproc_satingest_RB-3.4.2/post_paraprod_script.bash .
      4) Turn on entire satingest on devwcoss.

   When actually implementing obsproc_satingest.v3.4.2 into production:
      1) Shut down entire satingest on prodwcoss and devwcoss.
      2) Implement obsproc_satingest.v3.4.2 on prodwcoss and devwcoss.
      3) On prodwcoss and devwcoss, execute: /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/SVN/IMPLEMENTATION_RELEASES/obsproc_satingest_RB-3.4.2/pre_paraprod_impl_script.bash .
      4) Turn on entire satingest on prodwcoss and devwcoss.

   ====================================

   This must be implemented either simultaneously with or prior to the
   implementation of:
      v3.1.0 of obsproc_global,
      v1.5.0 of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.

   - IMPORTANT: The ingest web page has not yet been updated to reflect the
                changes here.

   New jobs JINPP_ATMS, JINPP_CRIS_399, JINPP_CRIS_431 and JINPP_OMPS should be
   initiated at the same time as now-removed job JINPP so that all four jobs
   will run simultaneously.

   =====>  IMPORTANT: As you can see, the CrIS-FSR 2211 database tanks
                      (b021/xx205) are very large now and will more than double
                      in size when JPSS-1 is on PDA.  The "crisfs" dumps in
                      /gpfs/hps/nco/ops/com/gfs/prod/[gfs][gdas].* are also
                      large (see Release_Notes.txt for new release of
                      obsproc_global.v3.1.0 for more information).

                      While it would be preferable to generate these, they can
                      be left out of this implementation per Andrew Collard. NCO
                      agrees, so JINPP_CRIS_2211 will not be initiated and thus
                      the GFS and GDAS dump jobs will not generate "crisfs"
                      dumps.  It should be noted that splitting up the JINPP
                      jobs and the multi-processing nature of the dumping means
                      that run time is not an issue here - only storage.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JINPP, JIPOES_SST, JISWD:
    - Updates were made to the above noted jobs to adjust the MACHINE definition
      to override the default server 140.90.190.143 (PDA) if PDA_SERVER is set
      in the ecflow script.
        eval MACHINE${n}=${PDA_SERVER:-140.90.190.143} # (PDA server)
      BENEFIT: Allows for quick switch from PDA to backup CBU since changes need
               only be made in ecflow scripts.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is (the only) part of OBSPROC.v8.0.3.
   This release was generated by NCO/IDSB.

   File /nwprod/versions/obsproc_satingest.ver was updated to export
   obsproc_satingest_ver=v3.4.1 rather than obsproc_satingest_ver=v3.4.0.

files modified, deleted or added (only):
 M obsproc_satingest/fix/bufrtab.005
 M obsproc_satingest/jobs/JIAEROSOL
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Added new processing family "VIIRS_WEEKLY_GVF" to copy NESDIS VIIRS weekly
      realtime GVF 4km global product (updated daily) from NESDIS PDA machine to
      /dcom/us007003/viirs directory (in grib2). Files will be retained for 30
      days.  These are normally available to copy around 1310 UTC each day.
      BENEFIT: Will be available to assimilation systems.
    - Renamed processing family "WEEKLY_GVF" to "AVHRR_WEEKLY_GVF" so as to not
      confuse it with new "VIIRS_WEEKLY_GVF" family.
    - Added copy of NOAA-19 AVHRR GVF grib2 file NPR.VGWG.NP.D?????.GRIBF to
      file family "AVHRR_WEEKLY_GVF" (in addition to existing NOAA-18 AVHRR GVF
      grib2 file). Expanded time when files from this family may be copied to
      include 1300 to 1330 UTC since the NOAA-19 AVHRR GVF file is normally not
      available until 1302 UTC.
      BENEFIT: This file just discovered on DDS and may be useful assimilation
               systems.

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab.005:
    - Minor comment changes.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JIAEROSOL:
    - New directory /dcom/us007003/viirs created and will hold copies of daily-
      updated VIIRS GVF grib2 files
      (GVF-WKL-GLB_v1r0_npp_s????????_e????????_c???????????????.grib2) going
      back 30 days.
    - Existing directory /dcom/us007003/avhrr will now hold copies of weekly
      AVHRR GVF grib2 files from NOAA-19 (NPR.VGWG.NP.D?????.GRIBF) going back
      30 days [in addition to existing weekly AVHRR GVF grib2 files from NOAA-18
      (NPR.VGWG.NN.D?????.GRIBF)].

NOTE: This version folds in the changes described in obsproc_satingest release
      3.1.2 below.  obsproc_satingest releases 3.2.0 and 3.2.1 did not include
      the changes in obsproc_satingest release 3.1.2, because 3.2.0 and 3.2.1
      were implemented only in the dbnet decoders (for bufr_tranjb) while 3.1.2
      was implemented only in satingest. This version brings the dbnet decoders
      (bufr_tranjb) and satingest into sync.

 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Minor changes by NCO/IDSB to bring these closer to compliance with
      production standards since these will remain on phase 1 for some time. As
      upgrades are made to phase 1 by NCO/IDSB these jobs will be less likely to
      have issues.
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Decreased values of HISTLENMIN and HISTLENMAX from previous defaults of
      900 and 1200 lines, resp., to 600 and 900 lines, resp., in family
      "DUST" and to 480 and 510 lines, resp., in family "BURNING_EMISSIONS".
      BENEFIT: Reduces history from over 4-5 months of processing to 2 months,
               saves space.
   JIAIRS:
    - Changed NDE PE1 machine to ESPDS/PDA machine for the AMSR2 family.
      REMOTEDSNGRP for this family is changed to PDA root directory accordingly.
      BENEFIT: NESDIS is transitioning from NDE to ESPDS/PDA.
    - For family "AMSR2", corrected a typo in the filename pattern for queried
      brightness temperature file that contains GCOM-W AMSR2 L1B brightness
      temperature data in chn. 6-36.
      BENEFIT: Although typo did not affect query it did not follow normal
                protocol.
    - Decreased values of HISTLENMIN and HISTLENMAX from previous values of
      17700 and 18000 lines, resp., to 6500 and 6800 lines, resp., in family
      "IASI_DB".
      BENEFIT: Reduces history from over 5 months of processing to 2 months,
               saves space.
   JIAVHRR:

      root directory accordingly.
      BENEFIT: NESDIS is transitioning from NDE to ESPDS/PDA.
    - Added new processing family "OMPSNP_V8" to handle future ingest of OMPS
      Version 8 nadir profile ozone data.  These will be tanked into database
      files b008/xx017.  They are NOT YET turned on for processing.
      BENEFIT: These will eventually be posted on ESPDS/PDA and replace the OMPS
               Version 6 nadir profile ozone data being tanked into database
               files b008/xx014.
    - Increased values of HISTLENMIN and HISTLENMAX from previous defaults of
      14000 and 20000 lines, resp., to 24700 and 25000 lines, resp., in families

                                --> implemented Jan 17, 2017

NOTE: This version does not include the changes described in obsproc_satingest
      release 3.1.2 below, because 3.2.1 was implemented only in the
      dbnet decoders (for bufr_tranjb) while 3.1.2 was implemented only in
      satingest. A future obsproc_satingest version will bring the dbnet
      decoders (bufr_tranjb) and satingest into sync.

 Source code changes:
   bufr_tranjb:
    - Corrected a bug introduced in v3.2.0 which resulted in an abort in the
      remapping when a rejected date was found for a report targeted for
      tank b001/xx102, this due to the file associated with remapped tank
      b001/xx002 (in unit 81) not being connected to the BUFRLIB software when
      it was expected to be such.
    - Corrected a bug introduced in v3.2.0  which resulted in some subsets
      remapped from tanks b001/xx102 or b001/xx103 to tank b001/xx002 being
      written to the wrong tank date for b001/xx002.
    - Increased string length for array CBAD to avoid internal write overflows
      which were causing run-time errors.
    - Added I/O status checks for internal writes to arrays CBAD and CREJ.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   All subsets in tank b001/xx002 will now have a YYYY MM DD identical to the
   YYYYMMDD qualifier in the tank directory path in /dcom.

obsproc_satingest release 3.2.0 --> released Nov 14, 2016
                                --> implemented Nov 17, 2016

NOTE: This version does not include the changes described in obsproc_satingest
      release 3.1.2 below, because 3.2.0 was implemented only in the
      dbnet decoders (for bufr_tranjb) while 3.1.2 was implemented only in
      satingest. A future obsproc_satingest version will bring the dbnet
      decoders (bufr_tranjb) and satingest into sync.

 M obsproc_satingest/sorc/build.sh
 M obsproc_satingest/ush/bufr_tranjb.sh
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 USH script changes:
   bufr_tranjb.sh:
    - Add documentation for a new variable "BORG_REMAP_xx102" which, when
      imported as a character string containing no more that 16 different 4-
      character bulletin originators (BORG), allows selected subsets with any
      of these BORG's to be remapped from b001/xx102 or b001/xx103 to
      b001/xx002 as a (temporary) workaround in response to the termination of
      many TAC BUFR buoy reports that had been written to b001/xx002 on 11/1/16.
      Once we are ready to handle the BUFR-feed in tank b001/xx102 this
      variable can be removed.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Removed commented touch line.
   bufr_tranjb:
    - Updated the logic used to establish a subset's representative time in 
      order to properly tank new data feeds.  
      BENEFIT: Removes flawed logic which used DATSIG (data significance) as a
               qualifier to determine observation time. This had caused
               failures in a new data sequence (in NC031006, still in
               development) which includes DATSIG values unrelated to time.
               Instead, applies a similar check on TSIG (time significance),
               which, if present, can be a useful qualifier for some data
               sequences currently processed.
    - Added logic to examine subsets being written into BUFR feed buoy tanks 
      b001/xx102 and b001/xx103 and remap select reports into tank b001/xx002.
      BENEFIT: This allows for a (temporary) workaround in response to the
               termination of many TAC BUFR buoy reports that had been written
               to b001/xx002 on 11/1/16. Once we are ready to handle the BUFR-
               feed in tank b001/xx102 this logic can be removed.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Tank b001/xx002 will be populated with b001/xx102 and xx103 reports selected
   for remapping.


 Big Brother information:
 ------------------------
   No changes.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   No changes in requested resources in the job cards for any jobs.
   No changes to memory usage for any jobs.
   Minor increase in run time for dbnet decoder jobs populating tanks b001/xx102
    and b001/xx103.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
  /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b001/xx002 will increase in size 5-fold over
  previous.  The corresponding increase in dump counts will be reflected in the
  RTDM "Hourly/RAP/Model(NAM/GFS/GDAS) Data Dump Tables" under the data type
  "dbuoy".
  This tank will still be ~35% smaller than its original size (prior to Nov 1,
  2016 when a large percentage of TAC BUFR buoy reports fed into this tank were
  terminated). {Note: Although the new b001/xx102 tank files are smaller than
  their pre-Nov 1, 2016 predecessors, there are still more reports in the new
  b001/xx002 tanks than in these tanks pre-Nov 1, 2016.  This should also be
  reflected in the RTDM "Model(NAM/GFS/GDAS) Data Dump Tables" which track dump
  counts in each cycle over the past 30-days.}

 JOB script changes:
   JIAIRS:
    - For family "AMSR2", changed filename pattern in all three brightness
      temperature files queried such that "v1r0" is replaced by "v2r0".
      BENEFIT: In mid-September 2016, NESDIS updated the version number for
               these files without prior notification.  As a result we stopped
               pulling and ingesting these files.  They are not yet dumped
               operationally.  This change will restore processing.  According
               to NESDIS there are no science or format changes associated with
               this new version.
   JISMI:
    - For family "GMI_TMBR", changed filename pattern in brightness temperature
      file queried such that "XCAL????-?" is replaced by "XCAL2015-C" and "V???"
      is replaced by "V04A".
      BENEFIT: Prevents processing of these files if NESDIS makes a future,
               unannounced version update.  Science or format changes in the new
               version could harm the models if no prior testing is done.  This
               will have no affect on the current processing of these files.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Increased likelihood of consistent builds by purging currently loaded
      environment modules and loading specific compiler module.  The
      default ibmpe module is then loaded for codes that might need it.
    - If environment variable $clobber is exported to this script with value
      "clobber_no", then the "make clobber" step is skipped. If $clobber not
      imported, "make clobber" will proceed as before.
      BENEFIT: This may be useful if one is debugging only one source code
               within a program with multiple source codes.
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - Updated to reflect changes in build.sh (see above).
    - Corrected some typos.


 Output changes:

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Export variable ndayarch as 45 rather than as 30 (default) in
      "BURNED_AREA" family.
      BENEFIT: NAM folks prefer to save 45 days of burned area files.
    - Added new processing family "HMS_SMOKE_PRELIM_EARLY" to handle daily
      ingest (pull and copy) of NESDIS Hazard Mapping System (HMS) hysplit
      smoke preliminary file (containing smoke-related fire hotspot
      information) at the "early" cutoff time of 0710 UTC (with backup runs
      every 30-min through 0840 UTC in the rare event the file is posted late
      on DDS).
      BENEFIT: This file will eventually be used by the new 06z CMAQ model.
    - Remove PART1 (statically-named file) processing.  This is obsolete (none
      of the families in here are prcoessed anymore, PART1 was set to "NO").
      - As a result, only PART2 (time-stamped file) processing occurs. All
        references to PART2 in environment variables here are removed since
        there is no longer a need to distinguish this from PART1.
   JIAIRS:
    - Added new processing family "MT_saphir" to handle ingest of
      Megha-Tropiques SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperature data.
      BENEFIT: These will be tested for eventual use in GSI.
    - Added new processing family "AMSR2" to handle ingest of GCOM-W AMSR2 L1B
      brightness temperature data (3 files: chn 89 A-horn, chn 89 B-horn, chn
      6-36).
      BENEFIT: These will be tested for eventual use in GSI.
    - Added new processing family "IASI_DB" to handle
      ingest of METOP IASI radiance data (direct broadcast from UW/SSEC).
      BENEFIT: These will be tested for eventual use in GSI.
    - History listing line length max, min increased from 4500, 4200 to
      18000, 17700 for "IASI" family.
      BENEFIT: Increases history from 2 to 8 days.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Turned off attempt to process GOES-E 1x1 sounder data in "1X1SND" family
      and GOES-E 1x1 cloud data in "1X1CLD" family.
      BENEFIT: GOES-E sounder went bad 11/20/2015, no files. Saves time.
   JINPP:
    - Added new processing families "CRIS_DB" and "ATMS_DB" to handle ingest of
      NPP CrIS radiance data (direct broadcast from UW/SSEC) and NPP ATMS
      brightness temperature data (direct broadcast from UW/SSEC), resp.
      BENEFIT: These will be tested for eventual use in GSI.
    - Family "OMPSTC" will now execute program bufr_tranmtypsbt with
      mod_sec3_desc set to default of "NO" rather than bufr_tranompstc with
      foreign BUFR table bufr_ompstc.bufrtable or
      bufr_ompstc.bufrtable.no_corners.
      BENEFIT: This had been added as a temporary means to transition from an
               older to newer form of the files being pulled off the remote
               server. It is no longer needed.
    - Each family now sets unique values for environment variable log. Before
      all families exported log as "tranjb_ingest_npp.out".
      BENEFIT: tranjb_ingest_npp.out was filling up so quickly that less than
               one day's worth of output was present. This change will allow
               for a much longer look-back period for output and will allow
               users to easily identify the output for each individual family. 
    - History listing line length max, min increased from 20000, 14000 to
      80000, 79700 for "ATMS" family.
      BENEFIT: Increases history from 2 to 8 days.
    - History listing line length max, min increased from 20000, 14000 to
      60000, 59700 for "CRIS" family.
      BENEFIT: Increases history from 3 to 9 days.
   JIOZONE_ORBIT:
    - History listing line length max, min increased from 3600, 3300 to
      10800, 10500 for "GOME" family.
      BENEFIT: Increases history from 3 to 9 days.
    - History listing line length max, min increased from 1200, 900 to
      2400, 2100 for "MLS" family.
      BENEFIT: Increases history from 5 to 10 days.
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable CRITICAL from YES
      to NO for "OMI" family.  The default value is currently used.
      BENEFIT: OMI data are only supported 8x5 at NASA and thus should be
               treated as data of opportunity.  If they go missing for a period
               of time, they will now not be raised to as high of a level under
               NCO's Big Brother alert system.  (This addresses NCO bugzilla
               ticket 371.)
   JIPOES_SST:
    - Removed obsolete processing family "NESDIS_AVHRR_MUT" (NESDIS Legacy SST
      retrievals).  NESDIS retired production of these data on 12/1/15 and
      there is no chance this would ever be turned back on.
    - Turned of attempt to process "VIIRS_ACSPO" family. VIIRS SST files were
      never promoted to the NCO area of NDE (they remain in the EMC area).
      There are issues with the size of the BUFR tanks and its impact on the
      run time for subsequent dump processing.  This will be turned back on
      once this has been rectified and files are populated to the NCO area of
      NDE. (Family was added in version 2.6.0 based on assumption files would
      soon be present in NCO area of NDE.)
      BENEFIT: Prevents job from wasting time lookng for non-existent files.
   JIQST:
    - Added new processing family "RAPIDSCAT_25km_KNMI" to handle ingest of ISS
      RapidScat 25km scatterometer data from KNMI (both 2- and 3-hour latency).
      BENEFIT: These will be tested for eventual use in GSI.
    - Removed obsolete (actually never used) processing family "OSCAT_KNMI"
      (OCEANSAT-2 OSCAT 50km scatterometer data from KNMI).
    - History listing line length max, min increased from 4500, 4200 to
      18000, 17700 for "ASCAT_50km" family.
      BENEFIT: Increases history from 2 to 8 days.
   JISMI:
    - Added variable COM_SSTOI to set leading path of dated directories to 
      search for input SST field used for SDR processing.
    - Exports script variables SUBDATE_CHECK and MESSAGE_LENGTH as YES and
      3500, resp. in "SSMIS" family.
      BENEFIT: SSMIS files come in with BUFR Sec. 1 message YY MM DD HH
               obtained from processing time and this often does not reflect
               the YY MM DD HH of subsets inside message as is expected in our
               obs processing. Exporting SUBDATE_CHECK as YES corrects this
               issue in BUFR tank files b021/xx201.  Exporting MESSAGE_LENGTH
               as 3500 forces BUFR messages in b021/xx201 to remain nearly the
               same size as before when SUBDATE_CHECK was NO for compressed
               messages and they were appended to tank as is (native BUFR
               message length upper limit is ~3500 bytes).  This prevents tank
               file b021/xx201 from doubling in size (since the default upper
               limit 10000 byte messages would otherwise be created with
               SUBDATE_CHECK=YES; these larger messages contain more subsets
               meaning a larger range of values must be stored for each element
               increasing the number of bytes required for each compressed
               element).
    - Added new processing family "GMI_TMBR" to handle ingest of GPM-core GMI
      L1C-R brightness temperature data.
      BENEFIT: These will be tested for eventual use in GSI.
    - Turned off attempt to process DMSP F-19 SSM/IS UPP data in "SSMIS"
      family.
      BENEFIT: F-19 SSM/IS instrument went bad 2/11/2016, no files. Saves time.
   JISSTFLD:
    - Removed.
      BENEFIT: The ecflow script to submit this job was removed from production
               on 5/3/16 because the file it processed (PRD.SST.FIELD.KM50) was
               no longer available from NESDIS on their DDS server.
   JISWD:
    - Turned off attempt to process GOES-E WV channel 10 and 11 sounder winds
      in "WVSND" family.
      BENEFIT: GOES-E sounder went bad 11/20/2015, no files. Saves time.

 Model script changes:
   existday.sh.ecf, existore.sh.ecf:
    - Corrected definition of script variable ndayarch in the remarks section
      of the docblock.
   existore.sh.ecf:
    - Added definition of existing script variable CLEAN in the remarks section
      of the docblock.
    - Modified such that different file streams can be processed using
      different values of ndayarch (number of days files are retained in root
      directory path under certain situations).  If not found for a particular
      file stream, the global value is used. 
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.  See BENEFIT for JOB script JIAEROSOL change
               above.
    - Modified such that different file streams can be processed using
      different values of SUBDATE_CHECK {determines if each subset should be
      unpacked and date-checked inside program bufr_tranjb prior to appending
      to output tank (=YES), or whole messages should just be appended to
      output tank without date-checking (=NO)} rather than just using the
      default that is set inside program bufr_tranjb.
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.  See BENEFIT for JOB script JISMI change #2
               above.
    - Modified such that different file streams can be processed using
      different values of MESSAGE_LENGTH (output BUFR message length upper
      limit set inside program bufr_tranjb) rather than just using the BUFRLIB
      default.
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.  See BENEFIT for JOB script JISMI change #2
               above.
    - Modified such that different file streams can be processed using
      different values of MXMSGL (maximum length in bytes of a bufr message
      that can read or written) in program bufr_tranjb.
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.
    - Updated docblock to modify definition of script variable IFILES_MAX_GET
      and to remove reference to condition code 2 in remarks since it can no
      longer occur.
    - Updated docblock to modify definition of script variable UNCOMPRESS_UNIX.
    - Modified to pass along new environment variable RENAME_FILE_SUFFIX which
      allows an original, input filename to be modified by appending the suffix
      $RENAME_FILE_SUFFIX to the name when copying it to output path in ush
      script ingest_copy.sh.  This must be set within individual families in
      the job script, there is no global value.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_tranjb.sh:
    - Updated documentation on variable MESSAGE_LENGTH since it can now be
      imported with a value less than 10000.
    - Remove upper limit on variable MESSAGE_LENGTH (before it was set to
      200000).
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.
    - If variable MESSAGE_LENGTH is not imported, then do nothing (before it
      was set to -99999).  Moves handling of default case to program
      bufr_tranjb.
      BENEFIT: Streamlines processing a bit.
    - Added documentation for new optional variable MXMSGL.
   ingest_copy.sh:
    - Looks for imported environment variable RENAME_FILE_SUFFIX and, if found,
      appends it to original, input filename (as a suffix) in order to rename
      the output file.
      BENEFIT: Allows same input file to be processed by more than one ingest
               "family" when the applicable families all execute this script
               with the same output directory path.
   ingest_process_days.sh, ingest_process_onetype_newdays.sh:
    - Corrected definition of script variable ndayarch in the remarks section
      of the docblock.
   ingest_process_onetype_neworbits.sh:
    - If the number of new files available on the remote server exceeds the
      limit set by variable IFILES_MAX_GET, transfer and process the first
      $IFILES_MAX_GET new files (rather than exit without processing any, as
      was done previously).
      BENEFIT: Can work through an accumulated backlog of data automatically
               without SPA intervention.
   ingest_translate_orbits.sh:
    - Pick up sst field from its original source rather than calling getges.sh
      to find a copy in the gdas or gfs com dir.
   ingest_process_orbits.sh:
    - Augmented variable UNCOMPRESS_UNIX such that when it is YES, it can
      uncompress files that have been compressed via bzip2.  Such files are
      identified via their file name suffix of either ".bz2" or ".bz".
      UNCOMPRESS_UNIX=YES can continue to uncompress files that have been
      compressed via gzip - these continue to be identified via their file name
      suffix (8 possibilites noted in the gzip man page). If UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is
      imported as YES and an input file has a suffix that does not match one of
      the expected patterns for either gzip or bzip2 compression, then the file
      is skipped.  This is also the case if the execution of gunzip or bunzip2
      fails.
      BENEFIT: Allow for the processing of raw files containing Megha-Tropiques
               SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperature data.  These are compressed
               via bzip2 on DDS.  Logic for UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is better
               streamlined.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Switch from using setlibs.rc to load_libs.rc (which loads library
      modules).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v11.0.1 to v11.1.0.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v11.0.1 to v11.1.0.
   bufr_tranavhrr:
    - Force a call to BUFRLIB routine openmb before adding content to a new
      BUFR subset.  This ensures the subset is written to a BUFR message with 
      Sec. 1 YY MM DD HH that accurately reflects the observation date and
      hour.
      BENEFIT: Allows downstream software to rely on the Sec 1 time stamp when 
               deciding whether an observation belongs in a specified time
               window. This also reduces risk of an observation being written
               to the wrong daily tank.
   bufr_tranjb:
    - Updated logic to override default BUFR message length upper limit in
      output messages.  Script environment variable "MESSAGE_LENGTH" now tested
      for "unset" in this code, rather than in parent bufr_tranjb.sh script.
      BENEFIT: Streamlines processing a bit.
    - There is no longer an upper limit of 200000 on value of "MESSAGE_LENGTH"
      imported into code.
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.
    - There is no longer a lower limit of 10000 on value of "MESSAGE_LENGTH"
      imported into code.
      BENEFIT: More flexibility.  See BENEFIT for JOB script JISMI change #2
               above.
    - Added logic to override BUFRLIB default setting of maximum length of any
      bufr message read or written (variable MXMSGL).
    - Added logic to enable setting restricted permissions on tanks for new 
      data types: wind energy nacelle (b000/xx020), wind energy tower
      (b002/xx020), ground based GPS-Met (b012/xx004), and Megha-Tropiques
      SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperatures (b021/xx242)
      BENEFIT: Preserves the distribution limitations on these data.
    - Removed obsolete references to specific tank directories.
      BENEFIT: More flexibility (allows better developer configuration).
   bufr_transaphir (transaphir.f and makefile):
    - New.  Reads in BUFR messages and subsets from a raw Megha-Tropiques
      SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperature data BUFR file previously copied from
      NESDIS' DDS server (and bunzip2'd) and writes them back to a BUFR file
      where the native message type and subtype of 3 and 10, resp., is changed
      to 21 and 242, resp.  It also encodes additional mnemonics RSRD (bit 1
      set) and EXPRSRD (missing) for each subset.
      BENEFIT: The producer of these data CNES (along with EUMETSAT) require
               that these data not be restributed (for all time).

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab_saphir_foreign:
    - New.  Foreign BUFR mnemonic table file used to decode Megha-Tropiques
      SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperature data (used by new program
      bufr_transaphir executed in job JIAIRS).
   bufrtab.012:
    - Added new Table A entry (message type) NC012255 to hold ISS RapidScat
      25km scatterometer data. (This had been reserved to hold OCEANSAT 50 km
       OSCAT scatterometer data, but the instrument died before it had ever
       been used.)
    - Moved future "DMSP/SSM-IS - Derived Products" from Table A entry (message
      type) NC012004 to NC012006 to avoid conflict with future Ground-based
      GNSS data which will use Table A entry (message type) NC012004.
    - Updated descriptions for some types, added comments.
   bufrtab.021:
    - Added new Table A entries (message types):
       NC021212 - holds NPP CrIS radiances (direct broadcast from UW/SSEC),
       NC021213 - holds NPP ATMS bright. temps (direct broadcast from UW/SSEC),
       NC021239 - holds METOP IASI radiances (direct broadcast from UW/SSEC),
       NC021242 - holds Megha-Tropiques SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperatures,
       NC021246 - holds GPM-core GMI L1C-R brightness temperatures,
       NC021248 - holds GCOM-W AMSR2 L1B brightness temperatures.
    - Improved the description for many Table A entries at top of table.

     JISMI and JISWD where new changes have been made.
   - See first two items in "Special Instructions" below.
     

 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are all NCEP networks.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is (the only) part of OBSPROC.v6.3.0.
   - NCO must subscribe to the new datasets on DDS:

        1C-R.GPM.GMI.XCAL????-?.????????-S??????-E??????.V???.bufr
   - NCEP must request that NESDIS populate the AMSR2 brightness temperature
     files:
        AMSR2-MBT-89A_v1r0_GW1_s??1????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr
        AMSR2-MBT-89B_v1r0_GW1_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr
        AMSR2-MBT-LR_v1r0_GW1_s2??????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr
     on both the EMC (where they already exist) and NCO areas of NDE PE-1 in
     order for NCO to test. (This may require an update to the NCO DAR to
     NESDIS.) They must remain in both areas through at least one week after
     implementation into NCEP production so that EMC can continue making test
     pulls. After this time they can be removed from the EMC area of NDE PE-1.
     (EMC will update its DAR to NESDIS to unsubscribe to these files.)

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Change Global geostationary satellite composite mosaic imagery McIDAS
      files to be critical with hours2alarm set at 3 hours.
      BENEFIT: These files are critical after the FY16 GFS upgrade because they
               are used to create the GCIP products.

               Needed once GFS moves to Phase 2 (presumably at the same time
               this release is implemented).  Ecflow scripts for JISMI can
               override this if necessary.

 JOB script changes:
   JISMI:
    - Remove attempt to pull and process DMSP F-16 satellite files in SSM/IS
      UPP (btemps) Family "SSMIS".
      BENEFIT: The SSM/IS instrument on DMSP F-16 was declared no longer
               functional on 2/2/16 and files stopped appearing on DDS. However
               on 3/1/16 test files, not intended for production, began
               appearing again on DDS (going back two weeks). These data were
               not coded to proper BUFR standard and this resulted in a failure
               of the 00z GFS on 3/2/16. These data had already been declared
               suspect in 10/2013 by EMC and relegated to monitor status in the
               GFS GSI.  Removing them will prevent any future issues if they
               again appear on DDS.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes (although DMSP F-16 will definitely never again appear in
   "ssmisu" dumps; this had already been the case after 2/2/16 until the
   unintended population of F-16 data on DDS on 3/1/16.

 JOB script changes:
   All job scripts:
    - Add variable BBDIR to point to Big Brother status file directory.
    - Allow SENDBB to be imported for all runs.  
      (Defaults to YES for NCO and NO for developer).
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Added three new families "BURNED_AREA", "BURNING_EMISSIONS" and
      "SAT_COMP_MOSAIC_IMGRY" to copy files containing burned area product,
      blended global biomass burning emissions product and global geostationary
      satellite composite mosaic imagery, resp. from NESDIS servers to /dcom on
      WCOSS.
      - "BURNED_AREA" files at both 1 and 12 km resolution re posted on DDS
         five times per day around 0530, 1130, 1730 and 2330 UTC, so the
         attempt to process this family (copying files into the date-
         independent directory "burned_area" in /dcom) will be performed every
         time this job runs (currently at 10- and 40-minutes past each hour).
         Files over the past 30 days will be maintained here. UNCOMPRESS_UNIX
         is set to its default value YES for the "BURNED_AREA" family. Files
         pulled from DDS are compressed.  The users of these files prefer that
         they be uncompressed on /dcom.
      - "BURNING_EMISSIONS" files for black carbon, organic carbon and sulfur
        dioxide species are posted on DDS once per day around 1400 UTC, so the
        attempt to process this family (copying files into the date-dependent
        directory "burned_emission" in /dcom) will be performed only between
        1310 and 1840 UTC (the NGAC model using it runs at 1835 UTC).
      - "SAT_COMP_MOSAIC_IMGRY" files for long-wave IR, short-wave IR and
        visible channel data, as well as for satellite resources metadata are
        posted on DDS eight times per day around 0030, 0330, 0630, 0930, 1230,
        1530, 1830 and 2130 UTC, so the attempt to process this family (copying
        files into the date-dependent directory "mcidas" in /dcom) will be
        performed every time this job runs (currently at 10- and 40-minutes
        past each hour). 
      BENEFIT: "BURNED_AREA" files will be tested by parallel NAM,
               "BURNING_EMISSIONS" files will be tested by Global Aerosol Model
               (NGAC) and "SAT_COMP_MOSAIC_IMGRY" files will be tested by
               Global Current Icing Potential (GCIP) experiment, all for
               eventual operational use.
    - A new ush script, ingest_copy.sh is executed by the "BURNED_AREA" family,
      by the "WEEKLY_GVF" family (replacing ingest_avhrr.sh), and by the
      "SMOKE", "SMOKE_WEST", "SMOKE_HAWAII", "DUST", "HMS_SMOKE_PRELIM" and
      "HMS_SMOKE_FINAL" families (replacing ingest_smoke.sh). (See USH script
      changes below for more information.)
    - Fixed a bug in the script that had resulted in some processing variables
      not being set under certain conditions.  These are now correctly set to a
      blank character under these conditions.
   JIAIRS:
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable FTYPE from
      "ncepbufr" to "bufr" for "IASI_efov" family.  The default value is
      currently used.
      BENEFIT:  The raw BUFR files copied over are not NCEP-flavored (e.g., no
                dictionary messages at top, etc.). The cword unblock processing
                will now be done prior to tranjb processing rather than within
                tranjb processing, as expected for non NCEP-flavored raw files.
                This change does not affect the content of database tanks for
                this family.
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable FTYPE from
      "none" to "bufr" for "AIRS", "AIRS_warmest", "AMSRE" and "AIRS_efov"
      families.  Of these, only "AIRS_efov" family is currently processed and
      its default value is currently used.
      BENEFIT:  Forces raw, input BUFR file to be unblocked and stripped of any
                extraneous characters in the BUFR messages prior to executing
                either program bufr_tranmtypsbt ("AIRS_warmest" and "AIRS_efov"
                families) or ush script bufr_tranjb.sh ("AIRS" and "AMSRE"
                families).  Although raw, input files in these families should
                already follow this convention, this change will ensure that
                the files are always in the expected form when translation
                processing scripts and/or programs operate on them.
   JIGOES_SST:
    - Renamed family "NAVY24HR" to "GOES24HR" and updated comments to reflect
      that the 24-hr average GOES/SST retrievals originate from NESDIS and not
      from the NAVY.
   JIOZONE_ORBIT:
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable FTYPE from
      "ncepbufr" to "bufr" for "OZONE_V8bufr" family.  The default value is
      currently used.
      BENEFIT:  The raw BUFR files copied over are not NCEP-flavored (e.g., no
                dictionary messages at top, etc.). The cword unblock processing
                will now be done prior to the execution of program
                bufr_tranmtypsbt.  Before, cword unblock processing actually
                was never done for files in this family because tranjb
                processing (where it would have run) occurs after the execution
                of another program (bufr_tranmtypsbt).  This was a bug.
                Although the absence of cword unblock processing caused no harm
                here since raw, input files should already follow this
                convention, this change will ensure that the files are always
                in the expected form when translation processing scripts and/or
                programs operate on them.
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable FTYPE from
      "none" to "bufr" for "GOME" family.  The default value is currently used.
      BENEFIT:  Forces raw, input BUFR file to be unblocked and stripped of any
                extraneous characters in the BUFR messages prior to executing
                program bufr_tranmtypsbt.  Although raw, input files in this
                family should already follow this convention, this change will
                ensure that the files are always in the expected form when
                translation processing scripts and/or programs operate on them.
   JIPOES_SST:
    - Updated family "NAVY_AVHRR" to pick up NAVOCEANO sst retrievals via new
      route.  The Navy pushes the data to NCEP and this job picks up the files 
      from rzdm, eliminating the need for NESDIS to host the NAVO data for us
      on DDS.  The data from the new feed arrives in smaller segments and is
      updated more frequently than that from the old feed.  The content is the
      same aside from some duplicates or (near-dupes) in the new feed.  With
      this upgrade intermediate files generated for downstream job
      JPOES_PHYRET_SST are smaller, more numerous and have a new naming
      convention.  Executes new ush script ingest_transst_poes_navo.sh rather
      than ingest_transst_poes.sh, as before. Some temporary logic is added to
      the end of this script to call a utility (ush script
      navo_poes_sst_bundle.sh) to bundle the data into files using the old
      naming convention.  This extra processing is only intended to continue
      for a short time until downstream job JPOES_PHYRET_SST (not under ObsProc
      control) is upgraded to read the new files.
    - Turn off ingest of family "NESDIS_AVHRR_MUT" (NESDIS Legacy SST
      retrievals).  NESDIS is retiring production of these data.  Most logic
      for this family is left in place for now in case there is need to quickly 
      turn it back on before NESDIS stops delivery.
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable FTYPE from
      "none" to "bufr" for "VIIRS_ACSPO" family.  The default value is
      currently used.
      BENEFIT:  Forces raw, input BUFR file to be unblocked and stripped of any
                extraneous characters in the BUFR messages prior to executing
                script bufr_tranjb.sh.  Although raw, input NPP files on the
                NDE machine should already follow this convention, this change
                will ensure that the files are always in the expected form when
                translation processing scripts and/or programs operate on them.
    - Increased values of HISTLENMIN and HISTLENMAX from previous defaults of
      450 and 600 lines, resp., to 3500 and 3800 lines, resp., in family
      "NAVY_AVHRR" and to 4500 and 4800 lines, resp., in family "VIIRS_ACSPO".
      BENEFIT: Provides a history over 1-2 months of processing.  Necessitated
               by the large number of files per day populated on the remote
               machine for these two families.
    - Decreased value of HOURS2ALARM from previous default of 9 hours to 6
      hours in families "NAVY_AVHRR" and "VIIRS_ACSPO".
      BENEFIT: It has been determined that any outage > 6 hours in either
               family should trigger an alarm.
   JIQST:
    - "QUIKSCAT", "ASCAT_50km", "ASCAT_25km" and "OSCAT_KNMI" families now
      execute script bufr_tranjb.sh immediately instead of first executing
      program bufr_tranquik.   Of these, only "ASCAT_50km" family is currently
      processed.
      BENEFIT: No need to execute bufr_tranquik, as immediate execution of
               bufr_tranjb.sh is all that is needed.  Saves processing time and
               storage space for database tank files and downstream dumps since
               BUFR messages remain compressed.

 Model script changes:
   existore.sh.ecf:
    - Updated definitions of script variables TARGETFILE, TARGETFILEn,
      TANKFILEn and EXECUTEn in the remarks section of the docblock to reflect
      a new option for simple file copying in ush script
      ingest_process_orbits.sh when TARGETFILE is imported as "same_name2" for
      case when script variable EXECUTE is imported as "copy_to_target".
    - Improved docblock description for variable FTYPE, and updated its
      definition to reflect that it no longer controls whether or not file
      uncompression will be performed if UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is set to YES.
    - Updated definition of script variable UNCOMPRESS_UNIX to reflect that it
      no longer has a dependency on FTYPE value, and that files will be
      uncompressed only if they contain 1 of the 8 specific file name suffixes
      noted in the gzip man page.
    - Modified to pass along new environment variable PROC_MULT_FILES which,
      when "YES", concatenates all input files for a particular family (with
      FTYPE "bufr" or "ncepbufr") into a single file prior to any subsequent
      processing. Different file streams can be processed using different
      values of PROC_MULT_FILES (if not found for a particular file stream, the
      global value is used).  The default is PROC_MULT_FILES=NO (which, as
      before, processes each new file one at a time).
    - Modified to pass along new environment variable IFILES_MAX_MULT which
      defines the  maximum number of new files on the remote machine for which
      the files will be concatenated prior to processing when new environment
      variable PROC_MULT_FILES for this family is set to "YES".  If greater
      than IFILES_MAX_MULT new files are found on the remote machine for a
      particular file family, PROC_MULT_FILES will be reset to "NO" for this
      family.  Different file streams can be processed using different values
      of IFILES_MAX_MULT (if not found for a particular file stream, the global
      value is used).  The default is IFILES_MAX_MULT=100.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_tranjb.sh:
    - Imported environment variable $CWORDush is set only if environment
      variable $cword is imported as 'yes'.
      BENEFIT: It is not otherwise needed.
    - Imported environment variable $CWORDX is now set when $cword is imported
      as 'yes' even though it is also set, with same default, inside $CWORDush.
      BENEFIT: Needed because $CWORDX is now invoked further down in this
               script and we want it to use the value set here, if indeed it is
               set here (see change below).
    - The following changes are in response to a change in source code
      bufr_tranjb to replace the hardwired, obsolete horizontal structure form
      of ush script cwordsh (/nwprod/ush/cwordsh) with the imported variable
      $CWORDush to now define the path to the ush script in the SYSTEM call for
      the case where an incomplete BUFR message is encountered at the end of
      the tank file (i.e., the tank is corrupted) during the appending process
      and must be repaired.
         - If either $CWORDush or $CWORDX is not imported or not set at a prior
           point in this script, and if imported environment variable
           $obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver (production version number for
           obsproc_shared/bufr_cword) is not set,
           $obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver is set to current production version
           in /nwprod/versions/obsproc_satingest.ver.
         - If imported environment variable $CWORDush is not imported or not
           set at a prior point in this script, it is set to current production
           path to ush script bufr_cword.sh which makes use of
           $obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver.
         - If imported environment variable $CWORDX is not imported or not set
           at a prior point in this script, it is set to current production
           path to executable bufr_cword which makes use of
           $obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver.
      BENEFIT: See BENEFIT for change #1 in source code bufr_tranjb below.
    - If the BUFR file being ingested was generated from a concatenation of
      individual BUFR files pulled from the remote server, the names of these
      individual files that contributed to the concatenation will be listed in
      the stdout when this script is executed (applicable only to satingest run
      type).
      BENEFIT: Useful diagnostic information for relating back to original BUFR
               files on remote server.
    - Added information on new optional variable MAXSS.  MAXSS can be an
      integer (up to eight digits) which will be picked up by executable
      bufr_tranjb to override the default setting for the max allowable number
      of data values in an uncompressed bufr subset.
   ingest_avhrr.sh, ingest_smoke.sh:
    - Removed.  These scripts no longer run in production (see change to job
      script JIAEROSOL above and new ush script ingest_copy.sh above).
   ingest_check_lapsed_data.sh:
    - Removed checks for obsolete filename patterns.
    - Replaced hardwired Big Brother status directory path with variable
      and create that directory if it does not exist.
      BENEFIT: Lapses in data availabilty can be easily detected during long 
               running ingest parallels.
   ingest_copy.sh:
    - New.  Copies a file previously ingested from a remote server into /dcom
      tank database.  No conversion is performed.  It can (optionally) also cut
      the yyyymmdd date qualifier out of the filename and insert it as a sub-
      directory in the output filename path (giving it a date-specific
      directory path).  It can also (optionally) remove files that are older
      than a specified number of days from the directory path.
      BENEFIT: Combines functionality of ush scripts ingest_avhrr.sh and
               ingest_smoke.sh, but generalized to handle almost any type of
               file.  Families in JIAEROSOL which had executed either of these
               ush scripts now execute this script (see above). Also allows new
               burned area product files to be copied into new
               /dcom/us007003/burned_area directory (these new data will be
               tested by parallel NAM for eventual operational use).
   ingest_process_onetype_neworbits.sh:
    - If environment variable PROC_MULT_FILES is imported as "YES" for a
      particular family (i.e., concatenate all input files pulled from remote
      server into a single file prior to any subsequent processing), it is
      reset to "NO" (process each pulled input file one at a time, the default)
      and a dignostic message to posted to the jlogfile and written to stdout
      if either:
         1) the value of imported environment variable IFILES_MAX_MULT (the
            maximum number of new files on the remote server for which the
            files will be concatenated prior to processing, defaults to 100 but
            can be user-specified) is less than the number of new files found
            on the remote server for the family being processed
            [BEFEFIT: prevents the creation of a concatenated file that might
                      be so large that it greatly slows down processing]
                   -- or --
         2) the imported environment variable FTYPE (input file type for the
            family being processed) is neither "bufr" nor "ncepbufr"
            [BENEFIT: some non-BUFR files go through additional processing that
                      precludes their being concatenated prior to such
                      processing]
   ingest_process_orbits.sh:
    - Fixed two minor bugs in the script that had no affect on output.
    - If script variable TARGETFILE is imported as "same_name2" for case when
      script variable EXECUTE is imported as "copy_to_target", then files
      pulled from the remote machine are simply copied to a directory path
      identified as "$TANKDIR/<YYYYMMDD>/$TANKFILE" with no change in the file
      name.  <YYYYMMDD> is obtained from qualifier in file name.
      (Note: This change was included in the logic moved to new ush script 
             ingest_process_orbits_subscript.sh, see last change to
             ingest_process_orbits.sh below.)
    - For case when script variable script variable EXECUTE is imported as
      "copy_to_target" and script variable TARGETFILE is imported as either
      "same_name2" or as the name of the output file, the date processing
      (i.e., pulling <YYYYMMDD> from qualifier in file name) is further
      generalized to handle cases where the qualifier (coming after either a
      "_" or "." delimiter) may be just yyyymmdd, or it may be suffixed with
      any number of alphanumeric characters.
      (Note: This change was included in the logic moved to new ush script 
             ingest_process_orbits_subscript.sh, see last change to
             ingest_process_orbits.sh below.)
     BENEFIT: Allows new blended global biomass burning emissions product files
              to be copied into new /dcom/us007003/<YYYYMMDD>/burned_emission
              directory.  These data will be tested by parallel Global Aerosol
              Model for eventual operational use.  Allows new global
              geostationary satellite composite mosaic imagery files which have
              date qualifier in form <yyyymmddhh> to be copied into new
              /dcom/us007003/<YYYYMMDD>/mcidas directory.  These data will be
              tested by the Global Current Icing Potential experiment for
              eventual operational use.  In both cases, the dated directory
              allows these files to be archived in run-history.
    - HISTLENMIN and HISTLENMAX now used to also define minimum/maximum length
      (in lines) of the new "${ORBITLIST}_copy.history" files, created when
      script variable EXECUTE is imported as "copy_to_target" and script
      variable TARGETFILE is imported as "same_name2", as well as the minimum/
      maximum length of the existing "$USERDIR/$TARGETFILE.history" created
      when script variable EXECUTE is imported as "copy_to_target" and script
      variable TARGETFILE is imported as the name of the output file.
      BENEFIT: Will prevent these history files from growing into perpetuity.
    - Improved docblock description for variable FTYPE, and updated its
      definition to reflect that it no longer controls whether or not file
      uncompression will be performed if UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is set to YES.
    - Updated definition of script variable UNCOMPRESS_UNIX to reflect that it
      no longer has a dependency on FTYPE value, and that files will be
      uncompressed only if they contain 1 of the 8 specific file name suffixes
      noted in the gzip man page.
    - File uncompression (when UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is imported as YES) now occurs
      regardless of value of FTYPE.  Before it could only occur when FTYPE was
      imported as bufr.
      BENEFIT:  Allows incoming compressed files from all sources, and in all
                formats, to be uncompressed (if desired) prior to downstream
                processing.
    - If uncompression is unsuccessful (when UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is imported as
      YES), a more detailed message is posted to the jlogfile (i.e., that
      processing continues with original file since since it is likely not
      compressed).  The same message is now also posted to stdout.
    - The construction of the uncompressed file name in variable dsname passed
      to the executing script or program, needed in order to match the file
      name output from the gunzip command which uncompresses the file when
      UNCOMPRESS_UNIX is imported as YES, now works for all 8 file name
      suffixes noted in the gzip man page (the suffix is removed from the
      uncompressed file name).  Before, the construction of the uncompressed
      file name in variable dsname it did not work properly for file names with
      suffixes ".gz" and "-gz".
      BENEFIT: Opens up file uncompression to more types of input compressed
               files.
      - If for some (highly rare) reason the construction of the uncompressed
        file name in variable dsname fails, a message will now be posted to the
        jlogfile and to stdout noting that subsequent processing of the file
        must be skipped.  All the usual bells and whistles follow (message
        posted to $ORBITLIST.history, non-processed family file counter bumped
        by 1, etc.). Steps are made to actually stop any additional attempts to
        process file.
    - If CWORDSH processing fails for a file, a more detailed message is posted
      to the jlogfile noting that subsequent processing of the file must be
      skipped.  The same message is now also posted to stdout.  All the usual
      bells and whistles follow (message posted to $ORBITLIST.history, non-
      processed family file counter bumped by 1, etc.).
    - An error in the execution of gunzip for compressed files (when
      UNCOMPRESS_UNIX=YES) now results in the file being skipped rather than
      continuing to be processed under the assumption that the file is likely
      just not compressed.  Although this may be the case, it is also possible
      that the file may be corrupted (e.g., file was being added at the time it
      was being pulled) and lead to undesirable results downstream.
      BENEFIT:  This change will allow the file to potentially be uncompressed
                by gunzip and processed the next time the job runs.
    - If new environment variable PROC_MULT_FILES is imported as "YES" for the
      particular family, each new BUFR file pulled from the remote server is
      concatenated with previous new files pulled over, in order to create a
      single BUFR file that is then sent on for subsequent processing.
      If PROC_MULT_FILES s imported as "NO" (the default) then, as before, each
      individual file pulled from the remote server is processed separately.
    - In order to facilitate the new logic just above, a large portion of this
      script, which deals with file processing, has been moved into a new ush
      script ingest_process_orbits_subscript.sh which is sourced by
      ingest_process_orbits.sh at different locations in the logic based on the
      value of PROC_MULT_FILES.
   ingest_process_orbits_subscript.sh:
    - New.  Contains a large portion of logic moved from
      ingest_process_orbits.sh that deals with nitty-gritty file processing.
      BENEFIT: Sourced inside ingest_process_orbits.sh at two different
               locations based on the value of new environment variable
               PROC_MULT_FILES.  Facilitates changes in
               ingest_process_orbits.sh needed to handle processing when
               PROC_MULT_FILES=YES vs. when PROC_MULT_FILES=NO.
   ingest_sncvgrib96, ingest_sncvgrib.sh, ingest_snodepgr.sh:
    - HISTLENMIN and HISTLENMAX now used to define minimum/maximum length (in
      lines) of the XXX.grb.history and XXX.grb.grib2.history files, where
      XXX=imssnow96 for ingest_sncvgrib96.sh, XXX=imssnow for
      ingest_sncvgrib.sh and XXX=snowdepth for ingest_snodepgr.sh.
      BENEFIT: Will prevent these history files from growing into perpetuity.
   ingest_translate_orbits.sh:
    - No longer executes gzip -d (i.e., gunzip) if program bufr_trantmi is
      about to be executed since the file coming into this program is now
      expected to have been uncompressed upstream in ingest_process_orbits.sh
      (see above).
      - This type is no longer processed in production.  If it is ever
        processed again either in production or in a historical run, job script
        JITMI would have to be resurrected and updated to set UNCOMPRESS_UNIX 
        to its default value YES for the "TRMMTMI" family.
    - If the file being translated was generated from a concatenation of
      individual BUFR files pulled from the remote server, the names of these
      individual files that contributed to the concatenation will be listed in
      the stdout when this script is executed (applicable only to satingest run
      type).
      BENEFIT: Useful diagnostic information for relating back to original
               files on remote server.
    - Minor Docblock change.
   ingest_transst_poes_navo.sh
    - New.  Processing specific to ingest of Navy sst retrievals from new feed.
   navo_poes_sst_bundle.sh
    - New.  Temporary utility script to generate lookalike files needed by
      current operational version of downstream job JPOES_PHYRET_SST.

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v10.2.5 to v11.0.1.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the bufrlib version from v10.2.5 to v11.0.1.
    - Add variable BUFR_LIB4_DA for dynamic allocation version of 4-byte real,
      4-byte int build of the bufrlib.
    - Point to /nwprod2 copy of all libs managed by NCO.
   bufr_tranquik:
    - Executable, source and makefile removed.  This program no longer runs in
      production (see change to job script JIQST above).
   bufr_tranavhrr:
    - Minor bug fixes and improved handling of real(8) data.  More debugging
      options added to makefile (currently not invoked).
   bufr_tranjb:
    - Replaces hardwired, obsolete horizontal structure form of ush script
      cwordsh (/nwprod/ush/cwordsh) with imported variable $CWORDush to now
      define the path to the ush script in the SYSTEM call for the case where
      an incomplete BUFR message is encountered at the end of the tank file
      (i.e., the tank is corrupted) during the appending process and must be
      repaired.
      BENEFIT: This allows for a transition to the new vertical structure form
               of bufr_cword.sh (as in production), and provides for the use of
               other versions of script (e.g. in developer runs).  The default
               for both $CWORDush and $CWORDX, used in production, is the path
               to the current production versions of ush script bufr_cword.sh
               and executable bufr_cword, respectively.
    - The bufr_cword processing (see above) now unblocks, rather than blocks
      the file in the corrupt tank repair process.
      BENEFIT: By default, BUFR files are now unblocked on WCOSS.
    - Added the following to the list of types which qualify as "restricted"
      when "CHGRP_RSTPROD" is "YES" (meaning group will be changed to "rstprod"
      and permission will be set to "640"):
        NC000100 - SYNOPTIC - FIXED LAND (NATIVE BUFR) (WMO RES 40)
        NC001101 - SURFACE MARINE SHIP, RESTRICTED (NATIVE BUFR)
        NC004011 - KOREAN AMDAR (NATIVE BUFR)
        NC004103 - AMDAR (NATIVE BUFR)
    - Improved array allocation when ingesting files with corrupt messages.
      BENEFIT: Reduced risk of failure and hung processes.
    - Use dynamic allocation version of bufrlib to override default array sizes
      (makefile change).
    - Override bufrlib's MAXSS default with 200000 or an imported value.
      BENEFIT: Allows processing of high resolution data.
    - More debugging options added to makefile (currently not invoked).
   bufr_tranpoessst:
    - Removed unnecessary reference to w3emc lib in makefile.
   bufr_tranpoessst_navo: 
    - New. Converts NAVOCEANO sst retrievals from new feed to bufr.
   bufr_cycsplit:
    - New. Reads in bufr file and writes out messages to output files based
      on synoptic cycle (centered on 0000, 0600, 1200 AND 1800 UTC).

 JOB script changes:
   JITMI:
    - Removed.
      BENEFIT: This ingest is now stopping abnormally because TRMM mission
               ended 4/8/15.
   JISMI:
    - Added pull and processing of DMSP F-19 satellite in SSM/IS UPP
      (btemps) Family "SSMIS". Will encode data into existing BUFR /dcom
      database tank b021/xx201.
      BENEFIT: These files are now available on NESDIS' DDS machine.  Both EMC
               and JCSDA would like to see these included in the "ssmisu" dumps
               for testing.
   JISNOW:
    - Minor comment changes to better define the family name for NIC snow/
      sea-ice ascii files.
   JIAIRS:
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable CRITICAL from
      YES to NO for "AIRS_efov" family.  The default value is currently used.
      BENEFIT: AIRS data are only supported 8x5 and thus should be treated as
               data of opportunity.  If they go missing for a period of time,
               they will now not be raised to as high of a level under NCO's
               Big Brother alert system.
   JINPP:
    - Minor comment changes to better define remote machine.
    - Changed default value for exported environment variable FTYPE from "none"
      to "bufr".  The default value is currently used for all families.
      BENEFIT:  Forces raw, input BUFR file to be unblocked and stripped of any
                extraneous characters in the BUFR messages prior to executing
                either program bufr_tranompstc ("OMPSTC" family) or ush script
                bufr_tranjb.sh (all other families).  Although raw, input NPP
                files on the NDE machine should already follow this convention,
                this change will ensure that the files are always in the
                expected form when translation processing scripts and/or
                programs operate on them.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Added new ingest family "EFCLAM" (GOES Imager Effective Cloud Amount from
      U. Wisc).  Will encode data into new BUFR /dcom database tank b012/xx160.
      BENEFIT: This change will eventually replace the non-standard job 
               JIGOES_CLOUD added in release 2.4.1. That job creates BUFR files
               containing these data from the same U. Wisc. ASCII files, but it
               simply translates them into BUFR one-by-one and writes the
               output to /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/wtxtbul for use by the
               FY15Q2 RTMA/URMA upgrade which is currently under evaluation.
               Once downstream RTMA/URMA dumps from tank b012/xx160 are
               created in /com, the RTMA/URMA GSI can be modified to run using
               these, hopefully in its next (FY15Q4) upgrade.  At that point
               all of the new files added in release 2.4.1 (JIGOES_CLOUD,
               bufrtab.eca, exigoes_cloud.sh.ecf and
               process_goesimgr_skycover.fd/*) can be removed in a subsequent
               obsproc_satingest release.
   JISWD:
    - Added new ingest family "VIIRS" (VIIRS IR Cloud Drift Wind Family - NPP
      satellite).  Will encode data into new BUFR /dcom database tank
      b005/xx090.
      BENEFIT: These new data will be tested for use in future set of model
               network upgrades.
   JIPOES_SST:
    - Added new processing family "VIIRS_ACSPO" to handle ingest of VIIRS SST
      Retrievals (NPP satellite) (via NESDIS ACSPO processing).
      BENEFIT: These data will be available for testing and for eventual use in
               production.
      NO!!!  Files will not yet be available on the NDE server so no data will
             be processed.  There are issues with the size of the BUFR tanks
             and its impact on the run time for subsequent dump processing.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - Remove lines forcing module HDF4 to be loaded prior to make and then
      unloaded after make for directory bufr_trantmi.fd, and module HDF5 to be
      loaded prior to make and then unloaded after make for directories
      bufr_tranmls.fd or bufr_tranomi.fd if using modules (load_libs.rc) to
      reference libraries. (Note this logic, which was needed to avoid a
      conflict between HDF4 and HDF5, was commented out because build.sh is
      currently using setlibs.rc to reference libraries.)
      BENEFIT: Logic no longer needed since bufr_trantmi has been removed (see
               below) and HDF4 library is no longer referenced by any
               makefiles.
   load_libs.rc and setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Increment the w3emc version from v2.0.5 to v2.2.0 to link to the newest
      operational version of this library.
    - Remove references to HDF4 library as it is no longer referenced by any
      makefiles. (In load_libs.rc the HDF5 module can now be loaded as there is
      no longer a conflict with removed HDF4 module.)
   bufr_trantmi, bufr_tranamsub:
    - Executable, source and makefile removed. These programs no longer run in
      production.
   bufr_tranjb (tranjb.f)
    - Minor coding change to avoid uninitialized variable.
   bufr_transkycovr (transkycovr.f90, makefile):
    - New. Reads U. Wisc. ASCII data files containing GOES Imager Sky Cover
      data.  This includes effective cloud amount (emissivity) and cloud-top
      pressure, at point locations.  Both point (center fov pixel) and averaged
      (fov pixels around center) values are present.  The single, center fov
      and averaged fov effective cloud amount data are translated into an
      output BUFR file.  Executed in job JIGOES_RADSND.
   bufr_transatw (transatw.f):
    - Modified to recognize NPP VIIRS polar winds (IR channel) which have BUFR
      satellite id 224.  Executed in job JSWD.

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab.012:
    - Added new Table A entry (message type) NC012160 to hold U. Wisc. GOES
      Imager effective cloud amount data subsets.  New local Table B mnemonics
      ECAS (BUFR descriptor 0-20-202) and ECAM (BUFR descriptor 0-20-203) added
      to hold single, center and multiple, averaged fov satellite measured
      effective cloud amount, resp.  Read by program bufr_transkycovr which is
      executed in job JIGOES_RADSND.
    - Added new Table A entry (message type) NC012023 to hold NPP/VIIRS SST
      (NESDIS ACSPO processing).  Added standard Table D mnemonic HHMM.  Added
      standard Table B mnemonics SCLF, HMSL, DBSS, DNQL, PIXT, VIIRGQ, SSTPQ
      and QPLR.
    - Added comments
       "MESSAGE TYPE 012-013 NO LONGER PRODUCED AFTER APRIL 2015",
       "MESSAGE TYPE 012-031 NO LONGER PRODUCED AFTER OCTOBER 2011",
       "MESSAGE TYPE 012-034 NO LONGER PRODUCED AFTER APRIL 2015",
       "MESSAGE TYPE 012-255 NO LONGER PRODUCED AFTER FEBRUARY 2014".
   bufrtab.005:
    - Added new Table A entry (message type) NC005090 to hold VIIRS polar
      winds (IR channel) from NPP satellite. Read by program bufr_transatw
      which is executed in job JISWD.
   bufrtab.021:
    - Added comments:
       "MSG TYPE 021-024 NO LONGER PRODUCED AFTER JUNE 2014",
       "MESSAGE TYPE 021-254 NO LONGER PRODUCED AFTER OCTOBER 2011".


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JITMI:
    - This job will no longer run in production. It had run 68 times per day,
      writing into /dcom tank b012/xx013, but has essentially been doing
      nothing since 4/8/15 (tank b012/xx013 has been missing since this date).
   Job JIGOES_RADSND:
    - New database files b012/xx160 will contain GOES Imager effective cloud
      amount from U. Wisc.  These are not yet used in any downstream
      processing.
   Job JISWD:
    - New database files b005/xx090 will contain NPP VIIRS IR satellite winds.
      These are not yet used in any downstream processing.
   Job JISMI:
    - Existing database files b021/xx201 will contain DMSP F-19 btemps (BUFR
      satellite id 287).
         Downstream Jobs JDUMP_MONITOR, JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
          - ssmisu dumps will contain this same additional information.
            (DMSP-19 SSM/IS btemps are not used by CDAS analysis. They are
             monitored by the global GSI.)
   Job JIPOES_SST:
    - New database files b012/xx023 will contain NPP/VIIRS SST (NESDIS ACSPO
      processing).  These are not yet used in any downstream processing.
      NO!!!  Files will not yet be available on the NDE server so no data will
             be processed.  There are issues with the size of the BUFR tanks
             and its impact on the run time for subsequent dump processing.


 Big Brother information:
 ------------------------
   Big Brother should now monitor:

     /com/logs/bb/ingest/ACSPO-SST_v1r0_npp_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr (new)
      NO!!!  ACSPO-SST_v1r0_npp* files will not yet be available on the NDE
             server so no data will be processed.  There are issues with the
             size of the BUFR tanks and its impact on the run time for
             subsequent dump processing.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   No changes in requested resources in the job cards for any jobs.
   No changes to memory usage for any jobs.
   Job JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Will take between 11 and 28 sec longer to run each time a new GOES Imager
      effective cloud amount file is processed. There are ~169 files
      available throughout each day. This job runs 128 times per day, so on
      average 1.3 files are processed in each run.
   Job JISWD:
    - Will take a couple of seconds longer to run each time a new VIIRS IR
      satellite wind file is processed.
   Job JISMI:
    - Will take a couple of seconds longer to run each time a new SSM/IS btemp
      file is processed.
   Job JIPOES_SST:
    - Will take between 25 and 48 sec longer to run each time a new NPP/VIIRS
      SST file is processed depending upon file size and time of day (files
      late in the day take longer to process through the tranjb database file
      append processsing). There are ~133 NPP/VIIRS SST files available
      throughout each day. This job will now run 48 times per day, so on
      average 2.8 files are processed in each run.
   No changes to run time for other jobs.


 Disk Space Changes:
 -------------------
   /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b012/xx160 - Increase ~1.5 Gb per day
   /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b005/xx090 - Increase ~12.5 Mb per day
   /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b021/xx201 - Increase ~123 Mb per day
   /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b012/xx023 - Increase ~18.3 Gb per day
      NO!!!  Files will not yet be available on the NDE server so no data will
             be processed into tank b012/xx023.  There are issues with the size
             of the BUFR tanks and its impact on the run time for subsequent
             dump processing.
   /com/gfs/prod/gfs.    - Increase ~117 Mb per day
   /com/gfs/prod/gdas.   - Increase ~243 Mb per day
   /com/cdas/prod/cdas.  - Increase ~243 Mb per day

   - See sorc/README.build


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test all jobs since w3lib version changed.  Need to especially look at
     jobs JIGOES_RADSND, JISWD, JISMI and JIPOES_SST where new changes have
     been made.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are all NCEP networks.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - Recommend archiving new sky cover and NPP/VIIRS SST BUFR tank files on
     HPSS.  Otherwise, no change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v5.0.0.
   This must be implemented either simultaneously with or prior to the
   implementations of:
      v2.0.4 of obsproc_cdas,
      v3.2.1 of obsproc_dump,
      v1.2.2 of obsproc_dump_monitor,
      v2.0.1 of obsproc_dump_post,
      v2.1.1 of obsprod_global,
      v2.0.3 of obsproc_nam,
      v3.5.0 of obsproc_prep,
      v2.1.0 of obsproc_prep_post,
      v2.0.3 of obsproc_rap,
      v2.0.4 of obsproc_rtma,
      v2.0.4 of obsproc_urma,
      v1.1.0 of radar_reflectivity_ref2grb,
      v1.2.0 of obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.

   - Since the changes to JIGOES_RADSND, JISWD and JIPOES_SST involve writing
     to a new tank, and the change to JISMI involves writing to an existing
     tank with no BUFR mnemonic table changes, there is no need to freeze any
     existing tanks.
   - There will be new history files added:
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/goesimg_EFCLAM.list
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/goesimg_EFCLAM.list.history
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/poeswind.viirs.infrared.list
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/poeswind.viirs.infrared.list.history
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/viirsst.orbitlist 
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/viirsst.orbitlist.history
     If these start fresh, the first job will likely timeout before all files
     are processed.  So, it might be a good idea to run this in a para area for
     several days prior to implementation and then copy the b012/xx160 tanks to
     /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b012, copy the b005/xx090 tanks to
     /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b005, copy the b012/xx023 tanks to
     /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b012 and also copy the history files associated
     with their generation (goesimg_EFCLAM.list, goesimg_EFCLAM.list.history,
     poeswind.viirs.infrared.list, poeswind.viirs.infrared.list.history,
     viirsst.orbitlist and viirsst.orbitlist.history) to
     /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist just prior to implementation.
   ObsProc will work with SPA office to come up with details to transition
   smoothly on implementation day.

   - The ecflow task scripts to submit JITMI, tmi.ecf, and all other tmi-
     related ecflow files should be removed.

   - The ecflow task script poes_sst.ecf should now submit JIPOES_SST twice
     each hour, at 25- and 55-min past the hour (before only submitted once
     each hour at 25-min past the hour).  Changed since there are ~133 NPP/
     VIIRS SST files per day.

obsproc_satingest release 2.5.1 --> released May 7, 2015

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - The "MODIS_AOD" family was moved from first in the order of processing to
      last for each run of this job. The "SMOKE" and "SMOKE_WEST" families were
      moved from second and third, resp. in the order of processing to third
      from last and second from last, resp. for each run of this job. All other
      families were moved up three places in the order of processing for each
      run of this job.
      BENEFIT: Recent connectivity issues with the remote server holding the
               MODIS AOD files has resulted in the "HMS_SMOKE_PRELIM" family
               processing running 3-4 minutes late in the 0940 UTC run of this
               job.  The result has been a failure in the 0945 UTC smoke job
               which needs the "prelim" file from the "HMS_SMOKE_PRELIM"
               family. This change will allow the "HMS_SMOKE_PRELIM" family to
               run prior to the "MODIS_AOD" family, meaning the "prelim" file
               should always be available to the smoke job.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes. The slightly later processing times for the "MODIS_AOD", "SMOKE"
   and "SMOKE_WEST" families has no adverse affect on production.


 Big Brother information:
 ------------------------
   No changes.

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is (the only) part of OBSPROC.v4.2.3.
   This release was generated by NCO/PMB.
   - The ecflow task script aerosol.ecf should be run at the additional time of
     0935 UTC so the "prelim" file can be pulled over 5 minutes sooner than
     before. (Extra insurance for this file being available for the 0945 UTC
     smoke job.)

   File /nwprod/versions/obsproc_satingest.ver was updated to export
   obsproc_satingest_ver=v2.5.1 rather than obsproc_satingest_ver=v2.5.0.

( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Update server and remote DSN info to pick up various smoke files from
      DDS instead of satepsdist1e.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Update server and remote DSN info to pick up NESDIS GOES sounding,
      cloud, and imager files from DDS instead of satepsdist1e.
    - Correct syntax setting default values for variables RUN and DATATYPE.
    - Restore default setting of variable DECDROOT that was introduced in
      release 2.0.0 and unintentionally deleted in release 2.3.0.  With this
      change, the default processing of families LCYCLD1 and LCYCLD2 will 
      revert back to the proper decoding software:
         /nwprod/decoders/decod_dcncld
      (This change is precautionary.  There is no immediate impact on results
      because the processing of these families has been falling back to an
      older version of the software that is still available in /nwprod/ush
      and /nwprod/exec and is consistent with the latest version linked by
      /nwprod/decoders/decod_dcncld).
   JIGOES_SST:
    - Update server and remote DSN info to pick up 24-hr average GOES SST 
      retrievals from DDS rather than satepsdist1e.
   JISNOW:
    - Update server and remote DSN info to pick up SH AutoSnow data from DDS
      instead of satepsdist1e.
   JISWD:
    - Update server and remote DSN info to pick up all files from DDS 
      instead of satepsdist1e.
    - Remove logic for obsolete families GMSIRCD, GMSWVIMG, and PTRIP.


 USH script changes:
   ingest_translate_orbits.sh:
    - Add logic to handle gzip'd GOES SST files.


 Source code changes:
   bufr_trangoessst.fd:
    - Modified date parsing to handle new filename pattern.
    - Additionally, initialize variable ICLEAR as a precaution.
    - Minor cleanup of commented obsolete statements.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Minor changes possible in some data used by models due to NESDIS migration to
   new processing server.


 Big Brother information:
 ------------------------
   Big Brother should now monitor:

 JOB script changes:
   JISNOW:
    - Point to NIC's IMS version 3 files on NESDIS' DDS server instead of
      version 2 files on satepsdist1e.
   JIGOES_CLOUD:
    - New.  Runs hourly and pulls over ASCII sky cover data files from Univ. of
      Wisconsin server, copies raw files to /dcom (wtxtbul), generates BUFR
      file from each ASCII file and writes them to /dcom (wtxtbul).
      BENEFIT: These sky cover files contain effective cloud amount and will be
                used by the FY15Q2 RTMA/URMA upgrade.

 Model script changes:
   exigoes_cloud.sh.ecf:
    - New.  Executed by JIGOES_CLOUD (see above).

 USH script changes:
   ingest_sncvgrib96.sh, ingest_sncvgrib.sh:
    - The logic which parses the date from the filename has been modified for
      the v3 naming convention and gzip'd files are uncompressed.

 Source code changes:
   process_goesimgr_skycover (process_goesimgr_skycover.f90, makefile):
    - New. Translates raw ASCII sky cover data (from files pulled from Univ. of
      Wisconsin server) into BUFR.  Executed by exigoes_cloud.sh.ecf (see
      above).

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab.eca:
    - New.  BUFR mnemonic table file used to encode sky cover data files into
      BUFR.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JIGOES_CLOUD:
    - New files will appear each day in /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/wtxtbul
      directory:
       - 24 BUFR files: rtma.t<cc>z.goessky.tm00.bufr_d (where cc=00,01, ... ,
         22,23 for current day) - these will vw read by the RTMA GSI
       - 24 BUFR files: urma.t<cc>z.goessky.tm00.bufr_d (where cc=00,01, ... ,
         22,23 for current day) - these will be read by the URMA GSI
       - ~35 ASCII files: G15_Imgr_<hhmm>_<yyyyjjj>.TXT (where jjj is either
         current day or previous day) - these are not read by any downstream
         processing
       - ~28 ASCII files: G13_Imgr_<hhmm>_<yyyyjjj>.TXT (where jjj is either
         current day or previous day) - these are not read by any downstream
         processing

 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test jobs JISNOW and JIGOES_CLOUD.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main users of this output are all NCEP networks.
   - No change in dissemination unless someone requests new sky cover BUFR
     files.
   - Recommend archiving new sky cover BUFR files on HPSS, but not archiving
     the huge raw ASCII sky cover files.  Otherwise, no change in archival on
     HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v4.1.1.
   - The new ecflow task script to submit JIGOES_CLOUD should be submitted each
     hour at 20 minutes past the hour.  It should be designed the same as all
     other satellite ingest ecflow task scripts, and should source
     /nwprod/versions/obsproc_satingest.ver.
   - Must be implemented before Jan 6, 2015 (or ask NIC to extend delivery
     of v2 filenames sent to satepsdist1e.nesdis.noaa.gov).
   - The only job that is changing is JISNOW which processes gridded fields,
     so there is no need to freeze tanks. (New job JIGOES_CLOUD does not write
     to any tanks.)
   - There will be changes to dsnames tracked in the following history files:
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/snocovr.dailylist96.history
       /dcom/us007003/ingest_hist/snocovr.dailylist.history
     but expect no harm if old dates are reprocessed during the first run.

files modified, deleted or added (only):
 M obsproc_satingest/jobs/JITOV
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JITOV:
    - The "ATOVS" (sounding) family pulls NOAA-19 and METOP-1(B) files rather
      than NOAA-18 and METOP-2(A) files from NESDIS' DDS server.
      BENEFIT: The NOAA-19 (PM), METOP-1(B) (AM) POES constellation is primary
               (see % below), thus these data are available sooner than for
               the previous NOAA-18 (PM), METOP-2(A) (AM) constellation.  In
               addition, NESDIS plans to discontinue the posting of NOAA-18
               ATOVS sounding files on DDS on 15 December 2014.
             % - As of the summer of 2014, NPP is the "official" PM POES
                 constellation satellite, however, these files are not yet
                 available to NCEP/EMC for testing.  NOAA-19 is still
                 considered primary w.r.t. its processing time.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JITOV:
    - Database files b003/xx102 will now contain ATOVS soundings from NOAA-19
      (BUFR satellite id 223) and METOP-1(B) (BUFR satellite id 3) rather than
      from NOAA-18 (BUFR satellite id 209) and METOP-2(A) (BUFR satellite 4).
         Downstream Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP:
          - atovs dumps will change in the same way as the database files
            b003/xx102.

   No change to memory usage.
   Negligible change in disk space and run time.

 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JIAVHRR, JIGOES_RADSND, JIGOES_SST, JINPP, JIOZONE14,
   JIOZONE_ORBIT, JIPOES_SST, JIQST, JISMI, JISWD, JITMI, JITOV:
    - Environment variable FIXbufr now exported as /dev/null rather than as
      /nwprod/decoders/decod_shared/fix (default first choice) or /nwprod/fix
      second choice (if /nwprod/decoders/decod_shared/fix does not exist).
      FIXbufr is second choice for path to bufrtab.XXX files in all translation
      codes, except for LaRC cloud processing in JIGOES_RADSND where it is the
      first choice for path to bufrtab.012 files (see change to ush script
      ingest_translate_orbits.sh below which accounts for this case).
      BENEFIT: The first choice for path to bufrtab.XXX files (except for
               LaRC cloud processing in JIGOES_RADSND), $FIXobsproc_satingest,
               is now populated with all of the bufrtab.XXX files read by the
               various translation codes in these jobs.  This change ensures
               that these jobs will fail (and alert NCO operators) rather than
               read a bufrtab.XXX that might be obsolete, if for some bizzare
               reason, the bufrtab.XXX files are not found in
               $FIXobsproc_satingest.
   JIAIRS:
    - Fixed a typo in family "AIRS" (this family not currently invoked).
   JINPP:
    - Family "OMPSTC" modified to now execute new program bufr_tranompstc
      rather than only script bufr_tranjb.sh, and to now point to a foreign
      BUFR mnemonic table file (bufr_ompstc.bufrtable). (See changes to source
      code bufr_tranompstc below for more information.)
   JISWD, JIOZONE14, JIOZONE_ORBIT, JITOV:
    - Remove attempt to pull NOAA-16 files (JISWD: AVHRR POES winds; JIOZONE14,
      JIOZONE_ORBIT: SBUV; JITOV: AMSU-A, AMSU-B, HIRS-3).
      BENEFIT: NOAA-16 was decommissioned on 10 June 2014. These jobs were
               wasting time attempting to pull non-existent files.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - The global default for wget_network_timeout (connection or read timeout
      in sec) is now set here (120 sec).
      BENEFIT: The default is no longer set in child ush scripts ingest_get.sh
               and ingest_query.sh (where it had also been set to 120, see
               changes to ush scripts ingest_get.sh and ingest_query.sh below).
    - Family "LGYCLD1" (1x1 FOV GOES cloud pulled from NASA/LaRC machine
      "integrity") now exports defaults for ITRIES_MAX_QUERY to 1 (try) at all
      times (vs. previous global default of 2 tries for most times and 1 try at
      a few times), and wget_network_timeout to 30 (sec) at all times (vs. 120
      sec at all times), respectively.
      BENEFIT: This machine has been down since May and each job has been
               wasting ~5 min attempting two connections with a timeout of 120
               sec for each (although actual timeout occurred after ~60 sec).
               These changes reduce the time for the failed attempt to connect
               to "integrity" to ~1 min.  If "integrity" comes back up, 1 try
               with a 30 sec timeout should still be suffient to connect to
               this machine.

 Model script changes:
   existore.sh.ecf, existday.sh.ecf:
    -  Different file streams can be processed using different values of
       script variable wget_network_timeout (connection or read timeout in
       seconds).  If not found for a particular file stream, the global value
       is used.  (The default for the global value is still 120.)
       BENEFIT:  This allows the parent job script the flexibility of setting
                 wget_network_timeout to different values for different
                 families. (E.G., see changes to job script JIGOES_RADSND
                 above.)
   existore.sh.ecf:
    - Updated definitions of script variables TARGETFILE, TARGETFILEn,
      TANKFILEn and EXECUTEn in the remarks section of the docblock to reflect
      a new option for simple file copying in ush script
      ingest_process_orbits.sh when TARGETFILE is imported as "same_name" for
      case when script variable EXECUTE is imported as "copy_to_target".

 USH script changes:
   ingest_get.sh, ingest_query.sh:
    - Imported variable wget_network_timeout (connection or read timeout in
      seconds) must now be passed in (before it had a default of 120).
      BENEFIT: This variable is now set in either the parent job or model
               script (where most other script variables are set).
   ingest_process_orbits.sh:
    - If script variable TARGETFILE is imported as "same_name" for case when
      script variable EXECUTE is imported as "copy_to_target", then files
      pulled from the remote machine are simply copied to a directory path
      identified as "$TANKDIR/$TANKFILE" with no change in the file name.
      BENEFIT: Useful for developer runs where the remote machine has
               restricted access (e.g., NDE). Files can be copied to local
               machine, maintaining their same same, and then be sent to
               another machine (if desired) where access is less restricted
               (e.g., emcrzdm).  History files are maintained as with usual
               satingest file processing such that each file is only ever
               pulled once from the remote machine (one likely restriction on
               the remote machine).
   ingest_translate_orbits.sh:
    - Changes to account for fact that executing job script JIGOES_RADSND is
      now exporting $FIXbufr as "/dev/null" (see change above).  As such, if
      NCO/SIB script ingest_cloud_NASA.sh is being executed and $FIXbufr is
      imported as "/dev/null", this script temporarily resets $FIXbufr to
      either /nwprod/decoders/decod_shared/fix (as a first choice), or
      /nwprod/fix (as a second choice, if the first choice location is not
      found).
      BENEFIT: This is needed because in the ingest_cloud_NASA.sh processing,
               $FIXbufr is the first choice for the location of the bufrtab.012
               files used by the translation codes.  This change prevents a 
               failure here when $FIXbufr is imported as "/dev/null".

 Source code changes:
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - remove "module use -a /nwprod/lib/modulefiles" and
             "module avail"
      BENEFIT: No longer needed and can slow down compilation.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - Updated to keep in sync with changes made by NCO regarding directory
      paths for various libraries.
   bufr_tranompstc:
    - New.  Reads in BUFR messages and subsets from a raw NPP OMPS-TC (ozone)
      BUFR file previously copied from NESDIS' NDE server and writes them back
      to a BUFR file which is in the proper form for databasing into /dcom (or
      equivalent) by the bufr_tranjb program.  Executed in job JINPP.
      BENEFIT:  This extra processing replaces direct bufr_tranjb processing of
                these raw BUFR messages.  This is necessary because NESDIS is
                about to change the content of these files to add lat/lon
                corner information at the beginning of each subset (requested
                by CPC).  This requires a BUFR table change (see fixed file
                bufrtab.008 changes below).  In addition, NESDIS is changing
                the message type/subtype from 008/016 to 008/018.  This new
                program processes either the current or future version of these
                files and outputs a BUFR file with the updated BUFR table
                (bufrtab.008) in either case.  The program initially checks the
                subtype of the first BUFR data message in the raw file.
                   - If the suptype is 18, the file is the new version with
                     lat/lon corners.  In this case, it is decoded using the
                     foreign BUFR table bufr_ompstc.bufrtable (see fixed file
                     changes below), and all information in each subset is
                     encoded exactly as is in the output BUFR file.  The only
                     change is the BUFR message subtype is output as 16 (no
                     change in the NCEP bufrtab.008 file).
                   - If the suptype is 16, the file is the current version
                     without lat/lon corners.  In this case, it is decoded
                     using the foreign BUFR table
                     bufr_ompstc.bufrtable.no_corners (see fixed file changes
                     below), and all information in each subset is encoded
                     exactly as is in the output BUFR file BUT after the lat/
                     lon corner information is encoded as missing.  There is no
                     change to the BUFR subtype in the output messages, it
                     remains the same as input, 16.
                These changes allow the bufrtab.008 change (to account for lat/
                lon corner information) to be implemented prior to NESDIS'
                implementation of the new raw NPP OMPS-TC (ozone) BUFR files
                containing lat/lon corner information.  This avoids having to
                implement the bufrtab.008 change at the exact time NESDIS makes
                their file change.

 Fixed file changes:
   bufr_ompstc.bufrtable
    - New.  Foreign BUFR mnemonic table file used to decode OMPSTC data without
      lat/lon corner information (read by new program bufr_tranompstc executed
      in job JINPP).  This is the current (older) form of these data.
   bufr_ompstc.bufrtable.no_corners
    - New.  Foreign BUFR mnemonic table file used to decode OMPSTC data with
      lat/lon corner information (used by new program bufr_tranompstc executed
      in job JINPP).  This is the newer form of these data which will later
      become operational when NESDIS populates it to NDE.
   bufrtab.003
    - Copied here from /nwprod/fix and updated.  Changes from production file:
      Only those message types (and their Table B and D entries) used by the
      satellite ingest jobs are retained. Thus, message type NC003010 and any
      Table B and D entries used only by this message type are removed. (Read
      by translation codes executed in jobs JIGOES_RADSND and JITOV.)
   bufrtab.008
    - The LAT/LON of total column observation corners has been added to message
      type NC008016 [NPP OMPS Total Column (Ozone) Data]. This is available
      in the newer form of these data which will later become operational when
      NESDIS populates it to NDE.  In the current (older) form, these data will
      be missing. (Read by translation codes executed in jobs JIAIRS, JIAVHRR,
      JIGOES_RADSND, JINPP, JISMI and JITOV.)
           - New standard Table B descriptor CORP (0-08-087) (code table
             containing corner postion of lat/lon observations).
           - New local Table D descriptor OBCORN (3-22-193) holding sequence
             "CORP CLATH CLONH" (lat/lon of total column observation corners).
           - New standard Table D descriptor OMPSTCOL (3-10-066) holding NPP 
             OMPS Total Column (Ozone) Data.  This had been described by
             Table A descriptor NC008016.
           - Table A descriptor NC008016 now includes 4 replications of OBCORN
             followed by CORP prior to the OMPS total column data previously
             described by NC008016 and now described by OMPSTCOL.  The
             descriptor for NC008016 changed from A-10-066 to A-62-222.
    - Copied here from /nwprod/fix and updated.  Changes from production file:
      Only those message types (and their Table B and D entries) used by the
      satellite ingest jobs are retained. Thus, message types NC008020,
      NC008021, NC008022, NC008023, NC008031 and NC008032 and any Table B and D
      entries used only by these message types are removed.
   bufrtab.012
    - Comment change.
   bufrtab.021
    - Copied here from /nwprod/fix and updated.  Changes from production file:
      Only those message types (and their Table B and D entries) used by the
      satellite ingest jobs are retained. Thus, message types NC021033,
      NC021034, NC021035, NC021036, NC021042 and NC021043 and any Table B and D
      entries used only by these message types are removed.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JINPP:
    - Database file b008/xx016 will now contain new lat/lon corner information.
      Initially this will be all missing (until NESDIS implements their updated
      raw OMPS-TC BUFR files on NDE).
   No other changes (unless special case of EXECUTE=copy_to_target and
   TARGETFILE="same_name is invoked - this is not expected to ever be done in
   production).


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   No change in requested resources in the job cards.
   Job JINPP:
    - disk space required per day for updated b008/xx016 tanks increases by 2%
    - will take slightly longer to run when their are new files to process in
      family "OMPSTC" since the new code bufr_tranompstc now runs
   Jobs JISWD, JIOZONE14, JIOZONE_ORBIT, JITOV:
    - will finish at least 1 min sooner with attempt to pull non-existent
      NOAA-16 files removed
   Job JIGOES_RADSND:
    - will finish ~4 min sooner as a result of fewer connection attempts and
      shorter connection timeout to NASA/LaRC machine "integrity" (if it is
      still down) in family "LGYCLD1"

   This is part of OBSPROC.v4.0.0.
   Since bufrtab.008 is being updated, the outlined procedure in
   http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/satellite_ingest.doc/update_bufrtable.html
   must be followed. Pay particular attention to the information associated
   with updates to bufrtab.008.  Items 2, 4 and 5 can all be skipped since
   there are no tanks associated with the NCO dbnet decoders that need to be
   updated here.

   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of:

obsproc_satingest release 2.2.1 --> released Aug 11, 2014
                                --> implemented Aug 12, 2014

files modified, deleted or added (only):

 M obsproc_satingest/ush/ingest_smoke.sh
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Added new family in Part 2 ("TIME-STAMPED FILE PROCESSING") called
      "DUST".  Pulls MYDdust dust GRIB files from NESDIS DDS machine and copies
      them to /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/wgrbbul/dust directory.  No other
      processing is performed on them. (This will only be invoked between 1200
      and 1230 UTC, incl., each day.)
      BENEFIT: Allows these new dust GRIB files to be present on WCOSS for
               testing by EMC/AQ group and for verification.

 USH script changes:
   ingest_qmgr.sh:
    - Modified to cd to imported script variable $DATAROOT (root working
      directory) (if it exists) prior to removing the contents of the working
      directory in the event the current job is killed.
      BENEFIT: Before, script cd'd to /tmpnwprd1 even though this may not be
               the root working directory in some production ingest jobs, and
               it would likely never be the root working directory in
               developer runs.
   ingest_smoke.sh:
    - Modified to cut date from proper location (columns) in filename for new
      MYDdust GRIB files.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JIAEROSOL:
    - Up to six new files will appear each day in directory
      /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/wgrdbul/dust. The files have the name:
      MYDdust.aod_conc.v6.3.4.<yyyymmdd>.hr<hh>.grib,
      where <hh> is 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 and 22.

 JOB script changes:
   All JOB scripts:
    - Require that the developer export their own particular temporary
      directory root ($DATAROOT) into the job scripts. If $DATAROOT is not set
      in these scripts, the script will abort.
      NOTE: This does not affect production.
      BENEFIT: This avoids having to hardwire a development-specific default
               temporary directory root in these job scripts. This can now be
               different for different development groups.
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Streamlined and improved documentation related to the division of Part 2
      processing into 5 groups that define the sets of families that run at 5
      different sets of times.
   JISMI:
    - Change TRANSFER_COMMAND from "ftp" to "wget".
      BENEFIT: Bug fix. The preferred method of transferring files from the
               remote machine for the satingest is "wget".  This is used in all
               of the satingest jobs except JINPP where "lftp" is used.
   JIQST:
    - Remove attempt to ingest OSCAT data.
      BENEFIT: This is a waste of time now that the instrument has died
               (2/20/14).

 Fixed file changes:
   bufrtab.005:
    - Renamed local Table D height assignment sequence MDPT (3-62-065) to
      RPSEQ2 (3-62-082) (also local) as latter is more commonly used in other
      NCEP BUFR tables. This holds standard Table B mnemonics HAMD (height
      assignment method, PRLC (pressure) and TMDBST (temperature).
      BENEFIT: Removes duplicate Table D sequence.
    - The following changes apply to message types NC005010 (GOES IR winds),
      NC005011 (GOES WV imager winds), NC005012 (GOES visible winds) and
      NC005014 (GOES WV sounder winds).
      BENEFIT: Transitions output BUFR to same NESDIS version 10 winds format
               as input BUFR from NESDIS.
         - Modified to output 10 (rather than 5) replications of height
           assignment information in RPSEQ2.
           BENEFIT: Allows for future expansion of this information from NESDIS
                    (last 5 replications are currently missing so no difference
                    from before at this time).
         - Replaced Table B mnemonic GCLONG (0-01-031) with OGCE (0-01-033) to
           define originating/generating center.
           BENEFIT: OGCE is now preferred by the WMO.
         - Added Table B mnemonics TPHR (time period or displacement,
           0-04-024), OFGI (origin of first guess information, 0-02-057) and
           SCBW (satellite channel band width, 0-02-154).
           BENEFIT: Additional information now available to users.
         - Added local Table D quality control sequence GQCPRMS (3-62-066),
           with four replications. This holds standard Table B mnemonics OGCE
           (originating/generating center), GNAP (generating application) and
           PCCF (percent confidence). It is applied to both wind direction and
           wind speed. The four replications hold the following in PCCF:
             1-EUMETSAT Quality Index without forecast consistency test (QIwo),
             2-NESDIS Recursive Filter Function (RFF),
             3-EUMETSAT Quality Index with forecast consistency test (QIwi),
             4-NESDIS Expected Error (EE).
           BENEFIT: RFF (used by GSI) now read from here rather than from
                    obsolete mnemonic RFFL. New additional Q.C. parameters
                    QIwi, QIwo and EE available for testing in all networks.
                    These will be used in the operational GBL GSI with the next
                    upgrade of that system.
    - Modified to output 4 (rather than 3) replications of quality control
      information in GQCPRMS for wind direction and wind speed in message types
      NC005070 (MODIS/POES IR winds), NC005071 (MODIS/POES WV imager winds) and
      NC005080 (AVHRR/POES IR winds).  The new 4'th replication of PCCF
      contains NESDIS Expected Error (EE).
      BENEFIT: Transitions output BUFR to same NESDIS version 10 winds format
               as input BUFR from NESDIS. New Q.C. paramter EE available for
               testing in all networks.  It will be used in the operational GBL
               GSI with the next upgrade of that system.
    - Removed local Table B mnemonic SWDL (satellite wind deep layer moisture
      flag, 0-25-201) from message types NC005010, NC005011, NC005012 and
      NC005014.
      BENEFIT: This local descriptor is not needed since the same information
               can be obtained from the existing standard (and NESDIS version
               10) menmonic SWCM (satellite derived wind calculation method,
               0-02-023).
    - Removed local Table B mnemonic RFFL (percent confidence based on NESDIS
      recursive filter function, 0-33-196) from message types NC005010,
      NC005011, NC005012 and NC005014.
      BENEFIT: This local descriptor is not needed since the same information
               can be obtained from the the 2'nd replication of the existing
               standard (and NESDIS version 10) menmonic PCCF.
    - Added local Table D receipt time sequence RCPTIM (3-52-003) to message
      types NC005010, NC005011, NC005012 and NC005014. This holds local Table B
      mnemonics RCTS (receipt time significance) and RCYR, RCMO, RCDY, RCHR,
      RCMI  (receipt year, month, day, hour, minute, resp.).
      BENEFIT: Receipt time is now encoded with each report.
    - Added local Table B mnemonic CORN (corrected report indicator, 0-33-215)
      to message types NC005010, NC005011, NC005012 and NC005014.  This is
      hardwired to be 0 (not corrected) for every report.
      BENEFIT: Corrected report indicator, although always set to not corrected
               now. may be useful in the future.
    - Added comments to improve documentation on the contents of replicated
      Table D sequence mnemonics containing information about intermediate wind
      and time stamp, height assignment, and quality control.

          - For GOES IR, WV imager, and visible wind reports in message type
            SATWND in the PREPBUFR files: mnemonics QIFY (EUMETSAT Quality
            Index with forecast consistency test), QIFN (EUMETSAT Quality Index
            without forecast consistency test and EEQF (NESDIS Expected Error)
            should now all be filled rather than missing [along with RFFL
            (NESDIS Recursive Filter Function) which was already filled].
          - For MODIS/POES IR and WV imager reports in message type SATWND in
            the PREPBUFR files: mnemonic EEQF (NESDIS Expected Error) should
            now be filled rather than missing [along with RFFL (NESDIS
            Recursive Filter Function, QIFY (EUMETSAT Quality Index with
            forecast consistency test) and QIFN (EUMETSAT Quality Index without

 JOB script changes:
   JISWD:
    - Added new family "SHRTWV" which ingests hourly NESDIS GOES-E and -W
      shortwave (3.9 micron) "night time" IR Winds.  Files (in WMO BUFR, version
      10) are pulled from the server satepsdist1e.nesdis.noaa.gov and are tanked
      into database files b005/xx019.
    - Removed check to make sure existing housekeeping and file-processing
      history files have the names which were updated in the last implementation
      (v2.0.0) for families IRCD, WVIMG, VISB, WVSND, MODIR, MODWV and AVHRR.
      This check was temporary and is no longer needed.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Job JISWD:
    - Creates new tank files containing NESDIS GOES-E and -W shortwave (3.9
      micron) "night time" IR Winds:
      /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b005/xx019 , where yyyymmdd is current date.

   Job JISWD:
    - NESDIS' switch to hourly GOES winds (coincident with this implementation)
      will result in a 3-fold increase in the size of daily /dcom tanks for
      types b005/xx010 (GOES IR), xx011 (GOES WV) and xx012 (visible). There is
      no appreciable change in the run time for this job stricitly due to
      NESDIS' switch to hourly GOES winds.
    - disk space required per day for new b005/xx019 3.9 micron wind tank files
      is ~ 128 Mbytes, with an average increase of 5 seconds in wallclock run

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v2.0.0.
   This must be implemented at EXACTLY the same time as NESDIS' promotion of
   the hourly GOES satellite winds to their production server, and
   simultaneously with the implementations of obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_global.v1.1.0, obsproc_nam.v1.1.0, obsproc_rap.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_rtma.v1.2.0 and obsproc_urma.v1.2.0.

   In ECFLOW, the JISWD initiation times should be modified to add a run at
   xx25 UTC each hour of the day.  In addition, the runs at 0024 and 1224 UTC
   should be moved back 1 minute to 0023 and 1223 UTC, resp.

files modified, deleted or added (only):
 M obsproc_satingest/jobs/JINPP
 M obsproc_satingest/ush/ingest_check_lapsed_data.sh
( A - added,  M - modified, D - deleted)


 JOB script changes:
   JINPP:
    - Updated to account for NESDIS' change on 4/17/14 to post files for all
      families directly into the nco_ops home directory on NDE rather than to
      root directory /stornext/ops/NDE_OP1/user/nco_ops.

 USH script changes:
   ingest_check_lapsed_data.sh:
    - Updated to put double quotes around all references to environment
      variable $fname (i.e., change $fname to "$fname").
      BENEFIT: NESDIS' change on 4/17/14 to post files for all families
               directly into the nco_ops home directory on NDE resulted in
               this script, which runs in the cwd where the files are copied,
               to expand $fname such that it became a string containing every
               file in the cwd since the "?" characters in this variable were
               interpreted as single-character wildcards.  This caused the Big
               Brother processing to break.  This change to put double quotes
               around $fname forces the "?" characters to be interpreted
               literally as intended.

 JOB script changes:
   All:
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for developer runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_satingest which points to
      directory path for generic satingest subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_satingest.$obsproc_satingest_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in scripts, exec, fix and
      ush directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Fatal error if $obsproc_satingest_ver not set (production only).
   Common to JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JIAVHRR, JIGOES_SST, JINPP, JIOZONE_ORBIT,
   JIPOES_SST, JIQST, JISMI, JISWD, JITMI, JITOV:
    - Obtains obsproc_shared/bufr_cword version number via imported environment
      variable $obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver.  This is defined in the upstream
      ecflow script.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_cword which
      points to directory path for generic cword subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.$obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} root in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Envirnoment variables $HOMEbufr $EXECbufr $USHbufr and $TABLEDIR no
      longer defined or exported.  Envirnoment variable $FIXbufr still exported
      (default /nwprod/fix) since $FIXobsproc_satingest may not yet be
      populated with some of the bufrtab.XXX files read by bufr_tranjb.sh and
      ingest_translate_orbits.sh.
   Common to JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JIAVHRR, JIGOES_RADSND, JIGOES_SST, JINPP,
   JIOZONE14, JIOZONE_ORBIT, JIQST, JISMI, JISSTFLD, JISWD, JITMI, JITOV:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Removed all references to $cyc since not used.
    - Fatal error if $envir or $job are not set by parent ecf script.
    - Fatal error if $DCOMROOT not set by parent ecf script (production only).
    - Export new environment variable $RUN_TYPE as 'satingest' (used by
      bufr_tranjb and bufr_tranmtypsbt to determine location for bufrtab.xxx
      tables since these are different for RUNTYPE=decoder)
    - Added new comments and updated existing comments.
   JIAEROSOL:
    - Increased max/min number of lines in "MODIS_AOD" family file-processing
      history files from 4500/4200 to 18000/16800 as there are a lot of small
      files processed throughout each day.  This change allows history to go
      back about a month rather than just a week or so and upgrades the check
      for repeat files on the server.
    - Exports $EXECUTE with default of 'bufr_tranjb.sh' rather than 'tranjb'
      for "MODIS_AOD" family to account for script name change.
    - Environment variable $timetype in part 1 now has default 'UTC' rather
      than 'GMT' ($timetype redefined to be "UTC" when time type is Greenwich).
   JIAIRS:
    - Exports $EXECUTE with default of 'bufr_tranjb.sh' rather than 'tranjb'
      for AIRS, AMSRE and IASI_efov families to account for script name change.
   JIGOES_RADSND:
    - Obtains obsproc_shared/bufr_cword version number via imported environment
      variable $obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver.  This is defined in the upstream
      ecflow script.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_cword which
      points to directory path for generic cword subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.$obsproc_shared_bufr_cword_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} root in order to point to files in exec and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $DECDROOT which points to NCO/SIB
      dbnet decoder root directory path (default /nwprod/decoders) - this is
      needed for defining a default for:
           - $FIXbufr (defaulting to $DECDROOT/decod_shared/fix as a first
             choice and /nwprod/fix as a second choice) which is the directory
             path to bufrtab.xxx for families LCYCLD1 and LCYCLD2.
           - $USHbufr (defaulting to $DECDROOT/decod_dcncld/ush/fix as a first
             choice and /nwprod/ush as a second choice) which is the directory
             path to NCO/SIB's EXECUTE script ingest_cloud_NASA.sh for families
             LCYCLD1 and LCYCLD2.
           - New environment variable $DCNCLD (defaulting to
             $DECDROOT/decod_dcncld/exec/decod_dcncld as a first
             choice and /nwprod/exec/decod_dcncld as a second choice) which is
             the path to NCO/SIB's program decod_dcncld executed by
             ingest_cloud_NASA.sh for families LCYCLD1 and LCYCLD2.
    - Envirnoment variables $HOMEbufr, $EXECbufr and $TABLEDIR no longer
      defined or exported.  Envirnoment variable $FIXbufr still exported for
      reasons noted above, and also since $FIXobsproc_satingest may not yet be
      populated with some of the bufrtab.XXX files read by bufr_tranjb.sh and
      ingest_translate_orbits.sh.
    - NetCDF module loaded only if either "LGYCLD1" and "LGYCLD2" family is
      selected for processing (before it was always loaded). 
   JIGOES_SST:
    - NAVY GOES/SST Retrieval family now identified with family name "NAVY24HR"
      and processed via a set command and do loop as is done in other satellite
      ingest jobs.  Although just one family is processed in this job now, this
      change allows for easy reordering of family processing (e.g., based on
      cycle time) should additional families be added in the future.
    - Output bufr_tranjb log file now defaults to more descriptive name
      tranjb_ingest_goes_sst.out (was the generic name tranjb_ingest.out).
   JINPP:
    - Exports $EXECUTE with default of 'bufr_tranjb.sh' rather than 'tranjb'
      for CRIS, ATMS, VIIRS, OMPSTC and OMPSNP families to account for script
      name change.
   JIOZONE14:
    - Envirnoment variables $HOMEbufr, $EXECbufr, $USHbufr and $TABLEDIR no
      longer defined or exported.  Envirnoment variable $FIXbufr still exported
      (default /nwprod/fix) since $FIXobsproc_satingest may not yet be
      populated with some of the bufrtab.XXX files read by bufr_tranmtypsbt.
    - Environment variable $timetype now has default 'UTC' rather than 'GMT'
      ($timetype redefined to be "UTC" when time type is Greenwich).
   JIOZONE_ORBIT:
    - New environment variable $CHECK_FOR_UNPROCESSED_OMI_FILES will only
      recheck for previously un-processed OMI files from this job if set to
      'YES' (default). Exports $ngroup as '1' here (was left out before).
   JIPOES_SST:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Fatal error if $cyc, $envir or $job are not set by parent ecf script.
    - Fatal error if $DCOMROOT not set by parent ecf script (production only).
    - Export new environment variable $RUN_TYPE as 'satingest' (used by
      bufr_tranjb and bufr_tranmtypsbt to determine location for bufrtab.xxx
      tables since these are different for RUNTYPE=decoder)
    - Added new comments and updated existing comments.
   JIQST:
    - Added new family "OSCAT_KNMI" which ingests OCEANSAT-2 OSCAT
      scatterometer data from KNMI.  Files (in WMO BUFR) are pulled from the
      server ftp.knmi.nl and are tanked into database files b012/xx255.  
      NOTE:  NWPROD MUST ADD THE USERID AND PASSWORD FOR ftp.knmi.nl INTO ITS
             .netrc file!!
      N O T I C E:  By the time this was implemented, OSCAT data were no longer
                    available.  The instrument stopped working on 2/20/14 and
                    was declared as "Dead" on 4/3/14.
   JISMI:
    - Output bufr_tranjb log file now defaults to more descriptive name
      tranjb_ingest_dmsp.out (was the generic name tranjb_ingest.out).
    - Now exports environment variable $TRANSFER_COMMAND with a default of
      'ftp' rather than allowing it to fall to this default value inside
      downsteam child scripts.  Added comment "change to wget?" since it may
      have been an oversight not to export this as 'wget' as is done in most
      other satellite ingest jobs.
   JISNOW:
    - Turned off copyforward for file SH4km_autosnow.grb.grib2 to prevent stale 
      file from being continually pushed forward into the wgrbbul directory 
      for $PDY at the start of each day.
    - Envirnoment variables $HOMEbufr, $EXECbufr, $FIXBUFR, $USHbufr and
      $TABLEDIR no longer defined or exported. 
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Fatal error if $cyc, $envir or $job are not set by parent ecf script.
    - Fatal error if $DCOMROOT not set by parent ecf script (production only).
    - Added new comments and updated existing comments.
    - Environment variable $timetype in part 2 now has default 'UTC' rather
      than 'GMT' ($timetype redefined to be "UTC" when time type is Greenwich).
   JISSTFLD:
    - Envirnoment variables $HOMEbufr, $EXECbufr, $FIXBUFR, $USHbufr and
      $TABLEDIR no longer defined or exported. 
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Removed all references to $cyc since not used.
    - Fatal error if $envir or $job are not set by parent ecf script.
    - Fatal error if $DCOMROOT not set by parent ecf script (production only).
    - Added new comments and updated existing comments.
    - Environment variable $timetype now has default 'UTC' rather than 'GMT'
      ($timetype redefined to be "UTC" when time type is Greenwich).
   JISWD:
    - Terra MODIS WV wind processing turned off - they have not been produced
      since July 2013 and their future looks bleak.  Will prevent wasting time
      trying to process them.
    - Housekeeping and file-processing history files renamed for all families.
      For IRCD, WVIMG, VISB, and  WVSND, this is in preparation for upcoming
      transition from 3-hourly to 1-hourly GOES winds (since they had "3hrly"
      in their names.  For the others the new names are more appropriate. For
      all active families (IRCD, WVIMG, VISB, WVSND, MODIR, MODWV and AVHRR),
      a check is made to make sure existing files in ingest_hist have the new
      names, and if not they are renamed prior to any processing (needed only
      for first run after this is implemented, and can be removed the next time
      this code is updated).
    - Output bufr_tranjb log file now defaults to more descriptive name
      tranjb_ingest_satwnd.out (was the generic name tranjb_ingest.out).
   JITMI:
    - TRMM TMI Product family now identified with family name "TRMMTMI" and
      processed via a set command and do loop as is done in other satellite
      ingest jobs.  Although just one family is processed in this job now, this
      change allows for easy reordering of family processing (e.g., based on
      cycle time) should additional families be added in the future.
   JITOV:
    - Exports $EXECUTE with default of 'bufr_tranjb.sh' rather than 'tranjb'
      for "ATOVS" family to account for script name change.

 Model script changes:
   existday.sh.ecf:
    - Removed all references to script variables $CNVRT2F77 and $ATTRIBUTES
      since these are no longer used now that cnvblk is obsolete.
      $USHobsproc_satingest replaces $USHbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the ush scripts.
      $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the executables.  Create output
      directories $USERDIR, $TANKDIR and $OUTDIR if they do not already exist.
      Now points to directory path $USHobsproc_satingest rather than directory
      path $utilscript to execute ingest_qmgr.sh (moved out of utililty ush
      location).  Added suffix ".sh" to ush scripts ingest_check_lapsed_data
      and ingest_process_onetype_newdays both of which this script executes.
      Aborts with condition code 98 if environment variable "timetype" imported
      with value "LOCAL" - this is not supported on WCOSS where the local time
      is hardwired to the UTC time.  The default for $timetype default is now
      "UTC" rather than "GMT".  Added new comments.  Updated information in
      docblock and some existing comments.
   existore.sh.ecf:
    - Removed all references to script variables $CNVRT2F77 and $ATTRIBUTES
      since these are no longer used now that cnvblk is obsolete.
      $USHobsproc_satingest replaces $USHbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the ush scripts.
      $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the executables.  Create output
      directories $USERDIR, $TANKDIR and $OUTDIR if they do not already exist.
      Now points to directory path $USHobsproc_satingest rather than directory
      path $utilscript to execute ingest_qmgr.sh (moved out of utililty ush
      location).  Added suffix ".sh" to ush scripts ingest_check_lapsed_data
      and ingest_process_onetype_neworbits both of which this script executes.
      USH script cwordsh renamed to bufr_cword.sh and moved from directory path
      $USHbufr to directory path $USHobsproc_shared_bufr_cword.  USH script
      tranjb renamed to bufr_tranjb.sh and moved from directory path $USHbufr
      to directory path $USHobsproc_satingest.  Aborts with condition code 98
      if environment variable "timetype" imported with value "LOCAL" - this is
      not supported on WCOSS where the local time is hardwired to the UTC time.
      The default for $timetype default is now "UTC" rather than "GMT".  Added
      new comments.  Updated information in docblock and some existing
      comments.

 USH script changes:
   bufr_tranjb.sh:
    - Renamed from tranjb.
    - Now includes hostname as well as process id in temporary filenames where
      only process id was present before.
    - $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the directory path to the
      executable bufr_tranjb.
    - USH script cwordsh renamed to bufr_cword.sh and moved from directory path
      $USHbufr to directory path $USHobsproc_shared_bufr_cword.  Extra
      condition on test for successful bufr_cword.sh run: not only must it have
      a rc=0, there must also be a non-empty unblocked output file produced.
    - Changes to account for the fact that there are now three choices for the
      directory path to the bufrtab.xxx files rather than just two choices.
    - Added information to docblock and new comments.  Updated some existing
      comments.
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.  Run times listed in output log file are now
      correctly stamped as UTC (before these UTC times were incorrectly listed
      as LST).
   ingest_avhrr.sh, ingest_smoke.sh:
    - Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_check_lapsed_data.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.  Added information to docblock and
      new comments.  Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_get.sh, ingest_query.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.  Now includes hostname as well as
      process id in temporary filenames where only process id was present
      before.  Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should
      always present date in UTC. Added information to docblock and new
      comments.  Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_process_days.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.  Now includes hostname as well as
      process id in temporary filenames where only process id was present
      before.  Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should
      always present date in UTC.  All references to "GMT" changed to "UTC".
      Removed all references to script variables $CNVRT2F77 and $ATTRIBUTES and
      logic which executed cnvblk since latter is now obsolete.
      $USHobsproc_satingest replaces $USHbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the ush scripts.
      $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the executables.  Added information to
      docblock and new comments.  Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_process_onetype_newdays.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.  Now includes hostname as well as
      process id in temporary filenames where only process id was present
      before.  Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should
      always present date in UTC.  All references to "GMT" changed to "UTC".
      Imported variable $timetype now checked for value of "UTC" rather than
      "GMT" ($timetype redefined to be "UTC" when time type is Greenwich).
      $USHobsproc_satingest replaces $USHbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the ush scripts.  Added information to
      docblock and new comments.  Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_process_onetype_neworbits.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.  Now includes hostname as well as
      process id in temporary filenames where only process id was present
      before.  Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should
      always present date in UTC.  Now accounts for rare cases where a
      particular group of files in a concatenated family was not found on the
      remote unix machine due to a connection/timeout issue in the query. These
      files will now not be removed from the housekeeping file containing the
      list of files on the remote machine file listing coming out of this run.
      This prevents a future run, where connection is ok in query, from
      considering these as new or repeat files.  $USHobsproc_satingest replaces
      $USHbufr as the environment variable representing the directory path to
      the ush scripts.  Added information to docblock and new comments.
      Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_process_orbits.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.  Now includes hostname as well as
      process id in temporary filenames where only process id was present
      before.  Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should
      always present date in UTC.  All references to "GMT" changed to "UTC".
      USH script cwordsh renamed to bufr_cword.sh and moved from directory path
      $USHbufr to directory path $USHobsproc_shared_bufr_cword.  USH script
      tranjb renamed to bufr_tranjb.sh and moved from directory path $USHbufr
      to directory path $USHobsproc_satingest.  Removed all references to
      script variables $CNVRT2F77 and $ATTRIBUTES and logic which executed
      cnvblk since latter is now obsolete.  $USHobsproc_satingest replaces
      $USHbufr as the environment variable representing the directory path to
      the ush scripts.  Added information to docblock and new comments.
      Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_qmgr.sh:
    - Moved from util/ush (when it was under /nwprod root) to ush here.
      Modified to execute ecflow commands only if imported variable $SENDECF is
      'YES' (the default).  $OWNER now defaults to "$USER" rather than "nwprod"
      so developer runs do not have to export it any longer ($OWNER will only
      default to "nwprod" if $USER is not set).  Added check to make sure this
      job is now in bjobs listing before testing against listing of all jobs in
      bjobs for $OWNER (since there is sometimes a lag).
   ingest_script_atovs1b.sh:
    - USH script tranjb renamed to bufr_tranjb.sh and moved from directory path
      $USHbufr to directory path $USHobsproc_satingest.  $EXECobsproc_satingest
      replaces $EXECbufr as the environment variable representing the directory
      path to the executables.  $FIXobsproc_satingest replaces $FIXbufr as the
      environment variable representing the directory path to the fixed files.
      Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_script_mls.sh, ingest_script_omi.sh:
    - Now includes hostname as well as process id in temporary filenames where
      only process id was present before.  USH script tranjb renamed to
      bufr_tranjb.sh and moved from directory path $USHbufr to directory path
      $USHobsproc_satingest.  $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the
      environment variable representing the directory path to the executables.
      Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_sncvgrib96.sh, ingest_sncvgrib.sh, ingest_snodepgr.sh:
    - Moved directory path to utility executable cnvgrib from hardwired
      /nwprod/util/exec to environment variable $utilexec set in upstream job
      script (now same as utility executable ndate which previously used
      $utilexec as its directory path).  All references to "GMT" changed to
      "UTC".  Imported variable $timetype now checked for value of "UTC" rather
      than "GMT" ($timetype redefined to be "UTC" when time type is Greenwich).
      $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the executables.  Added information to
      docblock and new comments.  Updated some existing comments.
   ingest_translate_orbits.sh:
    - Renamed to add suffix .sh qualifier.
    - Now includes hostname as well as process id in temporary filenames where
      only process id was present before.
    - $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces $EXECbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the executables.
    - $FIXobsproc_satingest replaces $FIXbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the fixed files (does not apply to
      bufrtab.XXX files which are still looked for in $FIXbufr).
    - $PARMobsproc_satingest replaces $PARMbufr as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the fixed files.
    - USH script tranjb renamed to bufr_tranjb.sh and moved from directory path
      $USHbufr to directory path $USHobsproc_satingest. 
    - Removed logic in "foreign" input BUFR file processing which pointed to a
      foreign BUFR table in $TABLEDIR (= $FIXbufr) as a first choice with
      $PARMbufr as a second choice (if foreign BUFR table not found in
      $TABLEDIR), and instead now points only to directory path
      $FIXobsproc_satingest to obtain this file (foreign BUFR table files will
      no longer ever reside in a parm directory, only in a fix directory).
    - NCEP BUFR tables bufrtab.XXX are now first looked for in directory path
      $FIXobsproc_satingest rather than in directory path $TABLEDIR, and if
      they are not found there they are looked for in directory path $FIXbufr
      (which is now defined simply as the path to non-obsproc fix directory).
      $TABLEDIR is no longer referenced in this script ($FIXbufr and $TABLEDIR
      were always exported with the same value before).
    - First choice for looking for scripts to execute is now directory path
      $USHobsproc_satingest, with last resort now being $USHbufr.  Before,
      first choice was $USHbufr.
    - Logic added to do special processing if NCO/SIB script
      ingest_cloud_NASA.sh is being executed:
        - switches priority for looking for bufrtab.012 in both
          ingest_cloud_NASA.sh and bufr_tranjb to $FIXbufr path (latter
          accomplished by exporting $RUN_TYPE as 'decoder' rather than
          as 'satingest')
        - forces newer versions of $USHbufr/ingest_cloud_NASA.sh to execute
          $USHobsproc_satingest/bufr_tranjb.sh, and forces older versions of
          $USHbufr/ingest_cloud_NASA.sh to execute
          $EXECobsproc_satingest/bufr_tranjb (even though older versions of
          ingest_cloud_NASA.sh are hardwired to execute parent script as
          $USHbufr/tranjb
        - the script ingest_cloud_NASA.sh will be found in the last resort
          directory path $USHbufr since it is under NCO/SIB control
    - All references to "GMT" changed to "UTC". 
    - Progam bufr_transsmi now reads land-sea tags (from unit 33) from
      location $FIXobsproc_satingest/nesdis.lstags_transsmi rather than from
      location $utilparm/nesdis.lstags.  The content is not changed.
    - Removed reference to unit 38 in program bufr_tranavhrr as this file
      (sst2dvar_aoi.61.90.clim.halfdeg, sea-surface temperature climatology on
      0.5 degree grid) has not been read by this program for a long time.
    - Added information to docblock and new comments.  Updated some existing
      comments.
   ingest_transst_poes.sh:
    - Now includes hostname as well as process id in temporary filenames where
      only process id was present before.  USH script tranjb renamed to
      bufr_tranjb.sh and moved from directory path $USHbufr to directory path
      $USHobsproc_satingest.  Script exit code now takes into account a
      non-zero exit code from any of the bufr_tranjb.sh executions inside it as
      well as a non-zero exit code from its bufr_tranpoessst execution (before
      it only took into account a non-zero return code from the latter) - this
      improves error diagnosis downstream.  $EXECobsproc_satingest replaces
      $EXECbufr as the environment variable representing the directory path to
      the executables.  Add check of variable $SENDCOM to determine whether to
      send output to $COMOUT.  Added information to docblock and new comments.
      Updated some existing comments.

 Source code changes:
   build.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to build one or all executables in the *.fd sub-directories of
      the sorc directory.  Reads either load_libs.rc or setlibs.rc file to 
      point to library version numbers needed by makefiles.
   clean.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to "make clean" one or more *.fd sub-directories in the sorc
      directory (generally after a build).
   install.sh in sorc directory:
    - New. Used to install (move) one or more executables (after build) in exec
      directory (assumed to be in same root directory as sorc).
   load_libs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefiles.  (Not read if setlibs.rc is read.)
   README.build in sorc directory:
    - New. Documentation on using build.sh, install.sh and clean.sh.
   setlibs.rc in sorc directory:
    - New. Read by build.sh - contains library version numbers needed by
      makefiles.  (Not read if load_libs.rc is read.)
   All source codes:
    - Makefile modified to use environment variables to point to library
      version numbers and to add sample build script and info in sorc
      directory.  This generalizes the library version information.
   bufr_tranamsua, bufr_tranamsub, bufr_trangoescld, bufr_tranhirs3,
   bufr_tranimgr, bufr_tranmhs, bufr_tranmls, bufr_tranomi, bufr_tranquik,
   bufr_transatw, bufr_transsmi, bufr_transsnd, bufr_trantmi, snow_sno16grb,
   snow_sno8grb, snow_sno96grb:
    - Minor source changes. Makefile cleaned up.
   bufr_tranavhrr:
    - Removed reference to unit 38 (sea-surface temperature climatology on
      0.5 degree grid) in docblock, as this program has not read this file
      (sst2dvar_aoi.61.90.clim.halfdeg) for a long time.  Makefile cleaned up.
   bufr_trangoessst:
    - No longer encodes BUFR dictionary table messages at top of output
      file(s) - will ensure that "official" bufrtab.012 is always encoded into
      NCEP BUFR tank when new tank is created by bufr_tranjb.  Makefile cleaned
      up.
   bufr_tranjb, bufr_tranmtypsbt:
    - Now looks for script environment variable "RUN_TYPE" via call to
      GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.  It is either 'decoder' (default) or
      'satingest'.  Now three choices for locating BUFR mnemonic table file
      bufrtab.XXX which depend upon value of "RUN_TYPE", rather than the two
      fixed choices before.  First choice remains tank directory (tank_dir)
      regardless of run type.  Second choice is obsproc_satingest fix directory
      (FIXobsproc_satingest) for satingest run type, and BUFR fix directory
      (FIXbufr) for decoder run type.  Third choice is FIXbufr for satingest
      run type and FIXobsproc_satingest for decoder run type. This change will
      allow dbnet decoder runs to use this version of this program since the
      dbnet decoder runs will use the BUFR mnemonic tables in its preferred
      location of FIXbufr. The satingest runs will, for now, use the BUFR
      mnemonic tables in their third choice location (FIXbufr), but will
      automatically transition to the second choice FIXobsproc_satingest once
      the BUFR mnemonic tables are available there.  Makefile cleaned up.
   bufr_tranpoessst:
    -  Mnemonic "OPTH" (aerosol optical thickness) is now always stored as
       missing for input NESDIS data because NESDIS stores a meaningless
       placeholder for this (it is valid for input NAVOCEANO data and stored as
       such in this case). Added new input argument "TYPE" to differentiate
       between NESDIS and NAVOCEANO as source of data.  Improved documentation.
       Makefile cleaned up.
   bufr_tranwindsat:
    - This program had not been in production since the transition from CCS to
      WCOSS as it processed the old, obsolete format WindSat data.  It is being
      put back into production as a place-holder for now (with no changes)  but
      it will continue to not be executed in production.  It will eventually be
      updated to handle the new format WindSat data.  Makefile cleaned up.

 Fixed file changes:
   bufr_amsua15_ta2tb.txt, bufr_amsua16_ta2tb.txt, bufr_hirsrtcf_ibm.dat,
   bufr_lowtopog.dat, lnd_sea_mask_dat:
    - No changes to contents.
   nesdis.lstags_transsmi:
    - Moved to here from /nwprod/util/parm and renamed from nesdis.lstags.  The
      content is not changed.  This file is read only by program bufr_transsmi
      in ush script ingest_translate_orbits.sh.
   bufr_goes.cloud.bufrtable, bufr_goes.sounding_1x1.bufrtable,
   bufr_goes.imgrdn.bufrtable:
    - Moved from parm subdirectory to fix subdirectory (since not parm file).
    - Changed Table D mnemonic DPINS (3-50-234) to the more standardized RPSEQ3
      (3-62-083) which has the same Table B components.  This has no affect on
      the output BUFR database tanks.
   bufr_V10satwind.4qual.bufrtable:
    - Moved from parm subdirectory to fix subdirectory (since not parm files).
    - No changes to contents.
   bufrtab.005:
    - Copied here from /nwprod/fix and updated.  Changes from production file:
      Only those message types (and their Table B and D entries) used by the
      satellite ingest jobs are retained. Thus, message types NC005015,
      NC005016, NC005017, NC005018, NC005021, NC005022, NC005023, NC005041,
      NC005042, NC005043, NC005044, NC005045, NC005046, NC005061, NC005062,
      NC005063, NC005064, NC005065 and NC005066 and any Table B and D entries
      used only by these message types are removed.
    - The NESDIS "Expected Error" (EE) quality indicator has been added to
      message type NC005019 (GOES short-wave IR winds). At this time, this
      type is not being ingested in production. It will begin being ingested
      with the next implementation (v2.1.0).
   bufrtab.012:
    - Copied here from /nwprod/fix and updated.  Changes from production file:
      Only those message types (and their Table B and D entries) used by the
      satellite ingest jobs are retained. Thus, message types NC012003 and
      NC012150 and any Table B and D entries used only by these message types
      are removed.
    - New message type NC012255 (OCEANSAT 50 KM OSCAT scatterometer data)
      added. (NEVER POPULATED SINCE OSCAT DIED !!!)


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JIAEROSOL, JIAIRS, JIAVHRR, JIGOES_RADSND, JIGOES_SST, JINPP,
    JIOZONE_ORBIT, JIPOES_SST, JIQST, JISMI, JISWD, JITMI, JITOV:
    - As a result of update to obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.v1.0.0:
       - If the name of the input file exceeds 120 characters (but is less than
         501 characters), program bufr_cword (before called cwordsh) will no
         longer stop abnormally due to a BUFRLIB abort as a result of its
         inability to the input file (truncated to 120 characters) which could
         not be found.  This had caused a silent failure in bufr_cword (before
         called cwordsh) which then caused a hard failure downstream in the
         job.
   Job JIQST:
    - Creates new tank files containing KNMI OSCAT scatterometer data:
      /dcom/us007003/<yyyymmdd>/b012/xx255 , where yyyymmdd is current date.
      (NEVER POPULATED SINCE OSCAT DIED !!!)

 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This is part of OBSPROC.v1.0.0.
   NOTE:  NWPROD MUST ADD THE USERID AND PASSWORD FOR ftp.knmi.nl INTO ITS
          .netrc file!!

   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.0.0, obsproc_dump.v3.0.0, obsproc_global.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_nam.v1.0.0, obsproc_rap.v1.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_urma.v1.1.0, obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.v1.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0.

   It should be implemented PRIOR to NESDIS' promotion of their hourly GOES
   satellite winds to their production server,
