# If this makefile is invoked by the command line
#       make -f makefile
# it will compile the fortran modules indicated by SRCS into the object
# modules indicated by OBJS and produce an executable named CMD.
#
# For a quick method to move that executable to it's expected target
# location ../../exec,  use the command line
#       make -f makefile install
#
# To remove all files produced by this makefile but leave the executable(s) use
# the command line
#       make -f makefile clean
#
# To remove all files produced by this makefile including the executable(s) use
# the command line
#       make -f makefile clobber
#
# To remove the source files and this makefile use the command line
#       make -f makefile void
#
# The parameters SRCS and OBJS should not need to be changed.  If, however,
# you need to add a new module add the name of the source module to the
# SRCS parameter and add the name of the resulting object file to the OBJS
# parameter.  The new modules are not limited to Fortran, but may be C, YACC,
# LEX, or CAL.  An explicit rule will need to be added for PASCAL modules.
