CHANGES TO OUTPUT AND FILE SIZES

 No new tanks are generated.
 The ATMS data tank, b021/xx203, will increase in size by ~50% as we add a 3rd ATMS instrument to the ingest.
 The CrIS data tank, b021/xx206, will increase in size by ~50% as we add a 3rd CrIS instrument to the ingest.
 The ATMS and CrIS tank sizes will return to normal when the S-NPP ATMS and CrIS instrument is switched off (i.e. no more *_npp_* files). NESDIS hasn't provided a date for this.


BIG BROTHER INFORMATION

 Start monitoring the following new filename patterns:
 $COMROOT/logs/bb/ingest/ATMS_v1r0_n21_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr

CHANGES IN COMPUTE RESOURCES

 No changes in requested resources in the job cards for any jobs were needed during EMC's testing.
 No changes to memory usage for any jobs were needed during EMC's testing.

SHARED SOFTWARE

 Satingest works together with module bufr-tranjb (THIS RELEASE REQUIERS v1.0.4)
 It is co-owned/co-developed with Decoders (emc.decoders-support@noaa.gov)

LIBRARIES

 w3emc   2.9.1
 bufr   11.7.0
 bacio   2.4.1
 hdf5   1.10.6
 netcdf  4.7.4
 libjpeg 9c

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

 See README.md or do as follows:
 A shell script to build and install satingest on NOAA platforms is provided:/ush/build.sh.
 Its usage on WCOSS is:
 INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_prefix> ./ush/build.sh

 NOTE:1.At the moment, the following does not work:
        cd ush
        ./build.sh (or alternatvely: source build.sh)
        It will be fixed soon.

      2.fix/CMakeLists.txt mentions the following files:
        fix/bufr_hirsrtcf_ibm.dat
        fix/bufr_lowtopog.dat
        fix/nesdis.lstags_transsmi
        These are binary files that belong to satingest, but are not on GitHub.
        They get downloaded from a server (emcrzdm) during the cmake install process and are used by satingest.

      3.Directory /TRIGGERS is only used by EMC for testing

      4.Directory /ecf is not part of the released code, b/c it is used only by NCO.
        It is added by the SPAs during implementation, see $PACKAGEROOT/satingest.v*.*.*

PRE-IMPLEMENTATION TESTING REQUIREMENTS

 A.
 satingest needs module bufr-tranjb.v1.0.3  or bufr-tranjb.v1.0.4 to be installed in order to run successfully.
 Module bufr-tranjb.v1.0.* is co-owned/co-developed with Decoders (emc.decoders-support@noaa.gov)
 See versions/*.ver for libraries and required versions

 NOTE: Separate CDF will be submitted for bufr-tranjb.v1.0.4, at the same time as satingest.v4.7.0

 B.
 Run JISATINGEST for the following satingest tasks (on implementation day) and verify the generation of the listed tanks:
 npp_atms - generates tanks b021/xx203
 npp_cris_431 - generates tanks b021/xx206

 C.
 If there is a NCO parallel run running, it must be stopped BEFORE the implementation,
 so that the prod run can pull the files from PDA OPS (and not run out of allowed PDA pulls per data type)

DISSEMINATION INFORMATION

 No change in dissemination methods.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

 1)IMPORTANT: This upgrade must be implemented --after-- the GFS/GSI upgrade adding NOAA-21 ATMS calibr. coeff. to GFS/GSI
   Contact Andrew.Collard@noaa.gov for a specific date.

 2)Confirm that NCO has an ACTIVE subscribtion to the following product(s) on PDA OPS a day or two prior to implementation day
   Short name: ATMS_BUFR
   RegEx:      ATMS_v1r0_n21_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr
   Dest Dir:   NDE/ATMS
   NOTE:One and the same Short name is used for ATMS_v1r0_npp_* ATMS_v1r0_j01_* and ATMS_v1r0_n21_* filenames

   Short name: CrIS_C0431_BUFR
   RegEx:      NUCAPS-C0431_v3r0_n21_s???????????????_e???????????????_c???????????????.bufr
   Dest Dir:   NDE/NUCAPS
   NOTE:One and the same Short name is used for NUCAPS-C0431_v3r_npp_* NUCAPS-C0431_v3r_j01_* and NUCAPS-C0431_v3r_n21_* filenames

 3) This satingest v4.7.0 requires that module bufr-trankb v1.0.4 is installed

 4)Follow the PRE-IMPLEMENTATION TESTING instructioins above.
   Implementation could be done at any hour b/c the new data will be monitored at first.

 DISCLAIMER: In case of Critical Weather Day, NESDIS's updates might be postponed.
             Obsproc will keep you informed of the new NESDIS update date, which will become the new implementation date.

PRELUDE

 OMI instrument longevity led to 6 digit orbit number in the filename (instead of 5).
 This implementation prepares satingest for the longer filenames.

 GBBEPx v3 products were retired on 1 May 2023. Satingest will no longer ingest this product.
 Data Flow will ingest an extended GBBEPx v4 data set into /dcom/YYYYMMDD/burned_emission (and to /dcom/YYYYMMDD/firewx)

CHANGES IN COMPUTE RESOURCES

 No changes in requested resources in the job cards for any jobs were needed during EMC's testing.
 No changes to memory usage for any jobs were needed during EMC's testing.

SHARED SOFTWARE

 Module bufr-tranjb v1.0.3 stays as is. It is co-owned/co-developed with Decoders (emc.decoders-support@noaa.gov)

LIBRARIES

 w3emc   2.9.1

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

 See README.md or do as follows:
 A shell script to build and install satingest on NOAA platforms is provided:/ush/build.sh.
 Its usage on WCOSS is:
 INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_prefix> ./ush/build.sh

 NOTE:1.At the moment, the following does not work:
        cd ush
        ./build.sh (or alternatvely: source build.sh)
        It will be fixed soon.

      2.fix/CMakeLists.txt mentions the following files:
        fix/bufr_hirsrtcf_ibm.dat
        fix/bufr_lowtopog.dat
        fix/nesdis.lstags_transsmi
        These are binary files that belong to satingest, but are not on GitHub.
        They get downloaded from a server (emcrzdm) during the cmake install process and are used by satingest.

      3.Directory /TRIGGERS is only used by EMC for testing
      
      4.Directory /ecf is not part of the released code, b/c it is used only by NCO.
        It is added by the SPAs during implementation, see $PACKAGEROOT/satingest.v*.*.*

 B.
 Run JISATINGEST for the following tasks (on implementation day) and verify the generation of the listed tanks:
 npp_omps 	: b008/xx017 (OMPS-NP)
 poes_sst 	: b012/xx012 (navy_avhrr)
 ssmi           : b021/xx246 (gmi_tmbr) (Please update on Feb 15, 2023)

 aerosol        : /lfs/h1/ops/prod/dcom/YYYYMMDD/af_viirs/AF-Iband_* files are pulled

 C.
 During the testing of satingest v4.5.0, please run JISATINGEST for radsnd.efclamzip with 2 minutes delay.
 This could be accomplished by delaying the processing of the entire radsnd family.
 Then run parallel RTMA obsproc job using the delayed radsnd.efclamzip tanks (b012/xx160). 
 The goal is to test if delaying the ingest would resolve the generation of blank *efclam*dump_d files for RTMA Rapit Update HH:15 cycles. 
 Please reach out to obsproc for clarifciation if needed.

 DISCLAIMER:
 i)The appearance of _n21_ may be confusing b/c NOAA-21 doesn't exist yet. 
   The names were taken from PDA I&T product desciptions, exactly as entered by NESDIS.
   The filenames on PDA I&T server, however, contain _npp_ and _j01_ as expected. 

 ii)The _TEST part of the names will probably drop out when subscribing on PDA OPS. 
    At the time of handing this code to NCO, these products are only on PDA I&T. 
    It is NESDIS's discretion to use the same filename on OPS.          

 B. Satingest v4.3.0 must be implemented in sync with bufr-tranjb v1.0.3

------------------ 
M-modified; A-added; D-deleted

What changes were made to the above code/scripts to support the new architecture?
 -satingest now uses cmake to build and install the software package 
 -build satingest repo with cmake
 -bufr_tranjb was moved out from underneath satingest and now is its own entity installed as a module
 -satingest software was modified to work with bufr_tranjb as a module (bufr_tranjb.v1.0.2)

Were any other changes made that aren’t directly related to the transition?
 Obsolete data types were removed from processing:MEGHA-TROPIQUES SAPHIR L1A2 Brightness Temperatures. Affected file: fix/airs

Are there any changes to incoming data needs or outgoing products? 
 No

If output filenames are changing, list the current and new filename:
 N/A

Compute resource information, for every job:
 See TRIGGERS/ directory

Usage:
 bash -l /path/to/triggers/lsf.JISATINGEST.DEVELOP.WCOSS2 $package $task  > /path/to/output/log/file/lsf.JISATINGEST.DEVELOP.WCOSS2.${task}$$ 2>&1
 For example:
 bash -l /path/to/triggers/lsf.JISATINGEST.DEVELOP.WCOSS2 satingest npp_omps  > /path/to/output/log/file/lsf.JISATINGEST.DEVELOP.WCOSS2.npp_omps$$ 2>&1
